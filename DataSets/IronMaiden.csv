"The Number of the Beast Lyrics[Intro: Barry Clayton]
Woe to you, o'er Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty-six

[Verse 1]
I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think, to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe
That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cos in my dreams, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Night was black, was no use holding back
Cos I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real, or just some kind of hell?

[Chorus]
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

[Verse 3]
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done

[Chorus]
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid the eyes
[Chorus]
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Six-six-six, the one for you and me

[Outro]
I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course15Embed"
"Fear of the Dark Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear
That something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

[Verse 2]
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared
To take a look, at the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you
[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear
That something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

[Verse 3]
Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear
That something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
[Instrumental Break 3:15-4:58]

[Bridge]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
[Verse 4]
Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear
That something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear
That something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

[Outro]
When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks alone23Embed"
"The Trooper Lyrics[Verse 1]
You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield, no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day
[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[Instrumental Break 2:10-3:01]

[Verse 3]
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there, gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear, I draw my parting groan

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh29Embed"
"Hallowed Be Thy Name Lyrics[Intro]
I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
Cos at five o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah

[Verse 1]
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
Take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

[Verse 2]
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears fall, but why am I crying?
After all, I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell, ""God be with you""
If there's a God, why has He let me go?
As I walk, my life drifts before me
And though the end is near, I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

[Verse 4]
Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth
When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion
[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hallowed be thy name
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hallowed be thy name

"Run to the Hills Lyrics[Intro]
White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came, too much for Cree
Oh, will we ever be set free?

[Verse 1]
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom, the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards, attack
[Chorus]
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

[Verse 2]
Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing's their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Indians are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

[Chorus]
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives
[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

"2 Minutes to Midnight Lyrics[Verse 1]
Kill for gain, or shoot to maim
But we don't need a reason
The golden goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death

[Pre-Chorus]
The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?
[Chorus]
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb

[Verse 2]
The blind men shout ""Let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers""
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast, yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies

[Pre-Chorus]
The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?

[Chorus]
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
[Instrumental Break 2:44-4:21]

[Verse 3]
The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun

[Pre-Chorus]
The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?

[Chorus]
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb

"Rime of the Ancient Mariner Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hear the rime of the ancient Mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea

[Interlude 1]
And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by a spell and the Mariner tells his tale

[Verse 2]
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow, fog flies on the Albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings
[Interlude 2]
And the ship sails on, back to the north
Through the fog and ice and the Albatross follows on

[Short Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
The Mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime

[Chorus 1]
Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm

[Verse 4]
The Albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse, a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the Mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung

[Chorus 2]
And the curse goes on and on and on at sea
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me
[Verse 5]
""Day after day, day after day
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere, and all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink""

[Short Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6]
""There,"" calls the Mariner, ""There comes a ship o’er the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?""
See, onward she comes
Onward she nears, out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but there's two

[Verse 7]
Death and she Life-in-Death
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now
Then, crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She, she, Life-in-Death
She lets him live, her chosen one
[Instrumental Break 4:14-5:53]

[Bridge]
""One after one by the star-dogged Moon
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
And I heard nor sigh nor groan
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump
They dropped down one by one.""

[Instrumental Break 6:22-7:44]

[Verse 8]
The curse, it lives on in their eyes
The Mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he

[Verse 9]
And by the light of the Moon
He prays for their beauty, not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too

[Verse 10]
Then the spell starts to break
The Albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain, hahaha

[Instrumental Break 8:56-11:15]

[Verse 11]
Hear the groans of the long-dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes

[Interlude 3]
And revenge still is sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on

[Verse 12]
Now the curse is finally lifted
And the Mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long-dead bodies
Form their own light and the Mariner's left alone

[Short Instrumental Break]

[Verse 13]
And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The Pilot's boat, his son, and the Hermit
Penance of life will fall onto him

[Chorus 3]
And the ship, it sinks like lead into the sea
And the Hermit shrieves the Mariner of his sins

[Verse 14]
The Mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made

[Chorus 4]
And the Wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on and on11Embed"
"Aces High Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble, we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks
There's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving
[Chorus]
Run, live to fly
Fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly
Fly to live, aces high

[Verse 2]
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again
Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109s out of the sun
Ascending and turning our Spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving, doing it again
Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving

[Chorus]
Run, live to fly
Fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly
Fly to live, aces high!4Embed"
"The Writing on the Wall Lyrics[Verse 1]
Across a painted desert lies a train of vagabonds
All that's left of what we were it's what we have become
Once our empires glorious, but now the empire's gone
The dead gave us the time to live and now our time is done

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now we are victorious, we've become our slaves
A land of hope and glory building graveyards for the brave

[Chorus]
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen that writing?
Can you see the riders on the storm?
Can you see them riding?
Can you see them riding?
[Verse 2]
Holding onto fury is that all we ever know
Ignorance our judge and jury, all we've got to show
From Hollywood to Babylon, holy war to kingdom come
On a trail of dust and ashes when the burning sky is done

[Pre-Chorus 2]
A tide of change is coming and that is what you fear
The earthquake is a-coming, but you don't want to hear
You're just too blind to see

[Chorus]
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen that writing?
Can you see the riders on the storm?
Can you see them riding?
Can you see them riding?
Riding next to you

"Wasted Years Lyrics[Verse 1]
From the coast of gold
Across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on far and wide
But now it seems
I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else

[Verse 2]
I close my eyes and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is?
You never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be 'til my dying day
[Chorus]
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years

[Verse 3]
Too much time on my hands
I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain, so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky

[Chorus]
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years

"Dance of Death Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
About a thing that I saw
One night wandering in the Everglades
I'd one drink but no more
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move

[Verse 2]
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace
Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led
[Verse 3]
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals
And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me

[Bridge]
And I danced, and I pranced, and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures - they were undead - all of them
They had ascended from hell

[Verse 4]
As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead
Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me
[Verse 5]
By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled
I ran like hell, faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6]
When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Have a drink and say a prayer for it

[Bridge]
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead

[Outro]
To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead16Embed"
"Empire of the Clouds Lyrics[Movement 1: 00:00-03:10]

[Instrumental intro]

[Intro]
To ride the storm to an empire of the clouds
To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost
To ride the storm to a kingdom that will come
To ride the storm and damn the rest oblivion

[Verse 1]
Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars
Grey lady giant of the skies
You hold them in your arms
The millionth chance they laughed
To take down his majesty’s craft
To India they say magic carpet float away
An October fateful day
[Movement 2: 03:10-06:58]

[Verse 2]
Mist is in the trees
Stone sweats with the dew
The morning sunrise, red before the blue
Hanging at the mast, waiting for command
His Majesty’s airship, the R101

[Verse 3]
She’s the biggest vessel built by man
A giant of the skies
For all you unbelievers, the Titanic fits inside
Drum roll tight her canvas skin, silvered in the sun
Never tested with the fury, with the beating yet to come
The fury yet to come

[Verse 4]
In the gathering gloom
The storm rising in the west
The coxswain stared
Into the plunging weather glass

[Verse 5]
We must go now
We must take our chance with fate
We must go now
For a politician, he can’t be late
[Verse 6]
The airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch
But the ship is in their backbone
Every sinew, every inch
She never flew at full speed, a trial never done
Her fragile outer cover her Achilles would become
An Achilles yet to come

[Verse 7]
Sailors of the sky, a hardened breed
Loyal to the king and an airship creed
The engines drum, the telegraph sounds
Release the cords that bind us to the ground

[Verse 8]
Said the coxswain
“Sir, she’s heavy, she’ll never make this flight“
Said the captain
“Damn the cargo, we’ll be on our way tonight“
Groundlings cheered in wonder
As she backed off from the mast
Baptizing them her water from the ballast fore and aft
Now she slips into our past

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 9]
Fighting the wind as it rolls you
Feeling the diesels that push you along
Watching the channel below you
Lower and lower into the night
Lights are passing below you
Northern France asleep in their beds
Storm is raging around you
A million to one, that’s what he said

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 10]
Reaper standing beside her
With his scythe cuts to the bone
Panic to make a decision
Experienced men asleep in their graves
Her cover is ripped and she’s drowning
Rain is flooding into the hull
Bleeding to death and she’s falling
Lifting gas is draining away

“We’re down lads“ came the cry
Bow plunging from the sky
Three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die
The flares to guide her path, ignited at the last
The empire of the clouds
Just ashes in our past, just ashes at the last

[Verse 12]
Here lie their dreams as I stand in the sun
On the ground where they built and the engines did run
To the moon and the stars
Now what have we done?
Oh, the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on
Dreams live on, dreams live on, on

The empire of the clouds may rest in peace
And in a country churchyard laid head to the mast

I've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding
And hiding behind that false mask
You know, and I know that you ain't got that long to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past

You're standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Now, I know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call

People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees

Red wine for the one to succeed me
For He is a man and a God

Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man, god preserved -
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell
I'll strike from the grave
[Chorus]
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death

O, God of earth and altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die

Take not thy thunder from us
Take away our pride

Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this

The light of the blind, you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the Nile are opening, you'll see

She came to me with a serpent's kiss
As the eye of the sun rose on her lips
Moonlight catches silver tears that I cry
So we lay in a black embrace
And the seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched and I waited for the dawn, oh

The light of the blind, you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the Nile are opening, you'll see

Bind all of us together

No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see

And still the wind and rain
For the one who will be king

"The Evil That Men Do Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her, If I could only see her now

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on

Circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you, some day I may return
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn

Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge

"Brave New World Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dying swans, twisted wings
Beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life
In this garden of fear
I have seen many things in a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more
Bring this savage back home
Wilderness, house of pain
Makes no sense of it all
Close this mind, dull this brain
Messiah before his fall
What you see, it's not real
Those who know will not tell
All is lost, sold your souls
To this brave new world

Where is salvation now?
Lost my life, lost my dreams
Rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here
Dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned

"If Eternity Should Fail Lyrics[Intro: Bruce Dickinson]
Here is the soul of a man
Here in this place for the taking
Clothed in white, stand in the light
Here is the soul of a man

Time to speak with the shaman again
Conjure the jester again
Black dog in the ruins is howling my name
So here is the soul of a man

[Verse 1: Bruce Dickinson]
When the world was virgin before the coming of men
Just a solar witness, the beginning of the end
From a world of magma to a cold rock face
The ascent of madness and a human race
We are strange believers all of us
There are stranger truths immortal lust
We rise from slumber he calls our name
Recalls our number abide with pain

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail
Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

[Verse 2: Bruce Dickinson]
To god’s illusion which I recall
Was our delusion before the fall
The angels come and the angels go
But the lord of light shining below
Eternal blackness beyond the stars
We think our wisdom will get that far
At the master’s table, the table’s bare
No land of plenty, devastation, despair

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world

"Hell on Earth Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Beginning of a sunrise
Bores a big hole in the sky
Not to reason why that
Armed children are in this world
And fighting in the name of god's way
Mourning bleak and utter waste
The vanity of the world is assured now

[Verse 2]
Prey upon the weak no more
The spirits of those who are gone
Propaganda of the battles
That are lost or won
And count your blessings still alive
Of those who managed to survive
Inside oblivion of that hell on earth

[Verse 3]
All you have been, all you have seen
Lost in somewhere in your dreams
How the angels they have fallen
All is nothing what it seems

[Verse 4]
In the voices that you hear now
In the voices in your head
Now are thinking of a lifetime
You can never feel again

[Verse 5]
I wish I could go back
Will never be the same again
Bled for all upon this hell on earth
And when I leave this world
I hope to see you all again
On the other side of hell on earth

[Verse 6]
Upon the eyes of good
I'm following the light again
In between the dark of hell on earth
On the other side
I'll see again heaven
So far away from this hell on earth

You dance on the graves who bled for us
Do you really think they'll come for us
Knowledge and virtue taken by lust
Live on the edge of those that you trust

You think that you have all the answers for all
In your arrogant way only one way to fall
Burning a lamp that is fire in your hands
Taking you further from these lands

""My son, ask for thyself another kingdom
For that which I leave is too small for thee""

[Instrumental Break 0:14-1:55]

[Verse 1]
Near to the east
In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son to Philip of Macedon
The legend, his name was Alexander

[Verse 2]
At the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegean Sea in 334 B.C
He utterly beat the armies of Persia
[Chorus]
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a legend amongst mortal men

[Verse 3]
King Darius the third
Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria

[Verse 4]
By the Tigris river
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis, the capital of Persia

[Chorus]
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a god amongst mortal men
[Instrumental Break 3:54-7:08]

[Verse 5]
A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia

[Verse 6]
Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on, marching on

[Verse 7]
The battle-weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in Babylon6Embed"

As the ground warms to the first rays of light

As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd

As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes, to ashes his grave

Beat the warning, the sound of the drums
Set the beacons afire for them all
Call to arms all the men far and wide
Have to fight now for dynasty, pride at stake
The invaders repel from the north
Keep out nomads who come from the plains
Northern grasslands awash with them all
Blocking the tribes that invade from the south of us

Rallying round to the call
We can hear far away are the sound of distant drums
And they need everyone at the wall
So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall

Survive on ledges bitten in dust
Knowledge and virtue is stricken by lust
Really believe that they're coming for us
Dancing on graves of those who bled for us
Driven away by our endless desire
Defeat by anger and our greatest fire
Attack again and try as they might
Hold them again and see them running

Rallying round to the call
We can hear far away are the sound of distant drums
And they need everyone at the wall

Ready now we wait
Must be steadfast
Must be patient
Must believe in
That we can win
What will save us

Now under siege have the real strength to hold them now
Have to believe that we can repel them
Faith in the years our ancestors taught us
Have the belief that we can protect the wall
Try if they can, we will overthrow them
Fight to the last, they can never own us
Battle of wills, we'll fight to the last man
Honour our dead so they never fought in vain

Avenge the merciful
Hold the great wall

And they need everyone at the wall

"22 Acacia Avenue Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you're feeling down, depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go (Go)
22 Acacia Avenue
Meet a lady that I know
So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybody's got their vice

[Verse 2]
If you're waiting for a long time
For the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
You might even get in free
So any time you're down the East End
Don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can know
[Pre-Chorus]
Charlotte, can't you get out from all this madness?
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't you know the risk of getting disease?
Some day when you've reached the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any more beautiful wares to show anymore

[Chorus]
22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Charlotte, isn't it time you stopped this mad life?
Don't you ever think about the bad times?
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?
Sometimes when you're strolling down the Avenue
The way you walk, it makes men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you

[Chorus]
22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight

You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?

Your life's good, don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you, don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you, stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags, you're coming with me

"The Red and the Black LyricsThe morals of life and the perils of death
Take the wrong way out running out of breath
Meet my match in the afterlife
Suppress the demons that plague the night
A tortured mind is a safe place to go
But the truth lurks down in the dark below
Step inside my inquisitive mind
Are you scared at what you just might find

See myself in the hall of mirrors
A different shape every step I take
A different mind every step of the line
But in the end they are all mine
Laughing sorrow inside your head
Can’t get out just a feeling of dread
I know this burden's a heavy load
A dark mistake never ending road
The black jack king and the red queen clash
The artful dodger he counts his stash
The joker’s wild like an impish child
While madame fortune she waits inside
The good luck charm is overkill
The tired old soldier says fire at will
Planes overhead go search destroy
The ones below human decoy

I need somebody to save me

Meanwhile we play the waiting game
The clock is struck the horse is lame
And when we think that this is done
Chance your luck a four leafed one
You hedge your bets the battle lost
To wait in vain and count the cost
The thin edged line
Between good and bad
And cast the luck be happy sad

I need somebody to save me

The red and the black
People don’t want the truth
Look in their eyes and you send them away
The red and the black
Fate and hypocrisy
Burden’s a heavy load there is no doubt
The red and the black
All out of luck again
How many chances can anyone have
The red and the black
Treachery out to win
There in the wrong place and at the wrong time
I need somebody to save me4Embed"

Can't you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land

Not alone with a dream
Just a want to be free
With a need to belong

"Moonchild Lyrics[Intro]
Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to Hell
And your trip begins
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires

[Instrumental Break 0:23-1:24]

[Verse 1]
I am he, the bornless one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devil's own, Lucifer's my name
[Chorus]
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal

[Verse 2]
I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones, I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death

[Chorus]
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight

The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die

[Verse 3]
One more dies, and one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you, young man
But I see you damned in endless night

Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child

"The Parchment Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
When the moon will rise again
Until we read the Parthian skin
Broken fears warning days are here again
'Fore we all to dust descend
Heaven knows when life will end
God to know in the mire, put out the fire

[Verse 2]
Know there is a cross to bear
In your primal quest of fear
No quarter now is given no less
Aslumber was my main ideal
Asunder did my spirit steal
Sceptred race uttered words in disgrace

Sweet revenge will be ours
Vengeance of a shaken world
Just remember that patience is no sin
And to find another way
Live to breathe another day
Lord of light in the darkness, our guide

[Verse 4]
In a tempest never shaken
Edge of doom is not mistaken
Countenance is not a sin
Gallant king, we bow to him
Fierce as wolf with a leopard skin
Dark and bitter deep within
Invader punished with his life
Vanquished in the morning

[Verse 5]
Sea of blood in light divine
Unholy reverence enjoyed
Intoxicated with their hell
Man immortal sickness dwell
Savage beasts troops engage
Assembled here to butcher blades
Smoke has darkened in the air
Smell of death and deep despair
[Verse 6]
Wilderness a tyrant dream
Sell your soul not give them power
Slay upon imperial crown
Witness now the witching hour
Bound himself to oath and king
Such loyalty, a shameless thing
Youth of agony still burn
Shedding parents blood

[Verse 7]
Never say a prayer to me
For this crime and treachery
Drinking from your cup of wisdom true
Many men will follow you
Now an army is raised
And our gods, they be praised
Death is but a guilted edge
Shall no more than we will pledge

[Bridge]
Hear the cry we are ready to believe

[Verse 8]
The prodigal has returned
Give us our own revenge
With the power he learned
We will burn the same again
A betrayal of angels in a foreign land
A revenge for the merciful destiny at hand
[Verse 9]
For all those who have written
In the sand will be told
That the same will happen, searching for gold
Like a fire in the sky
I can feel strength return
Heading for afterlife, meet me there

"The Book of Souls Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sacrifices buried with kings
Accompany them on a journey with no end
To an afterlife that’s rich with fruit of all the gods
And to face the demons
Of their underworld haunts

[Verse 2]
The sentient is sent to seek out all the truth
A flight to earth that is a given from his birth
To rise from ashes of the dead
Out of the fire is sent to fulfill man’s desire

[Pre-Chorus]
By power day and night and death he ruled them
The sky and earth and the fires too
Two headed reptile, symbol of his reign
Universes of the underworld
A life that’s full of all the wealth and riches
Can never last for an eternity
After living in a golden paradise, the ultimate sacrifice
[Chorus]
Prophecy of sky gods, the sun and moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon
Falling of ages, forest of kings
The search for the truth, the book of souls

[Verse 3]
The rulers of planets and stars
The power of the kings of traders and the wars
Planetary cycles and the phases of the moon
Is in the document a kingdom they will learn

[Pre-Chorus]
They were praying to the gods of nature
And were living in the cities of stone
Towers reaching upward to the heavens
Sacred wonders for the world unknown
Make their lives be a mystery no more
Records kept and the passing of laws
Sacred gods to the book of lies
When a civilization dies

Prophecy of sky gods, the sun and moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon
Falling of ages, forest of kings
The lost book of souls, destruction begins

Ascending the throne wearing feathers and shells
He brought back their lives from the void
Alien invasion brings nothing but death
Mass exodus and plant life destroyed

The underworld caves, Mayan slaves
Defeat of the dark Lords, the ultimate proof
In the place where the ancestors rule

"Sign of the Cross Lyrics[Intro]
Eleven saintly shrouded men
Silhouettes stand against the sky
One in front with a cross held high
Come to wash my sins away

[Verse 1]
Standing alone in the wind and rain
Feeling the fear that is growing
Sensing the change in the tide again
Brought by the storm that is brewing

[Verse 2]
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
Some of the doubt in the things you believe
Now that your faith will be put to the test
Nothing to do but await what is coming
[Verse 3]
Why then is God still protecting me
Even when I don't deserve it?
Though I am blessed with an inner strength
Some, they would call it a penance

[Verse 4]
Why am I meant to face this alone?
Asking the question time and again
Praying to God won't keep me alive
Inside my head, feel the fear start to rise

[Verse 5]
They'll be saying their prayers when the moment comes
There'll be penance to pay when it's Judgment Day
And the guilty'll bleed when that moment comes
They'll be coming to claim, take your soul away

The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross

They'll be bringing us all immortality
Holding communion so the world be blessed
My creator, my God'll lay my soul to rest

"For the Greater Good of God Lyrics[Verse 1]
Are you a man of peace, or a man of holy war?
Too many sides to you, don't know which anymore
So many full of life, but also filled with pain
Don't know just how many will live to breathe again

[Verse 2]
A life that's made to breathe destruction or defense
A mind that's vain, corruption, bad or good intent
A wolf in sheep's clothing, or saintly or sinner
Or some that would believe a holy war winner

[Verse 3]
They fire off many shots and many parting blows
Their actions beyond the reasoning only God would know
And as He lies in Heaven, or it could be in Hell
I feel he's somewhere here, or looking from below
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I don't know, I don't know

[Chorus]
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

[Verse 4]
More pain and misery in the history of mankind
Sometimes it seems more like the blind leading the blind
It brings upon us more of famine, death and war
You know, religion has a lot to answer for

[Chorus]
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

[Verse 5]
And as they search to find the bodies in the sand
They find it's ashes that are scattered across the land
And as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind
A shot is fired somewhere, another war begins
[Verse 6]
And all because of it, you'd think that we would learn
But still the body count, the city fires burn
Somewhere, there's someone dying in a foreign land
Meanwhile, the world is crying, ""stupidity of man""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Tell me why, tell me why

[Chorus]
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is

"Infinite Dreams Lyrics[Verse 1]
Infinite dreams, I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again

[Verse 2]
Someone chasing, I cannot move
Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end and will I transcend?
Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
It's getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep
[Verse 3]
Even though it's reached new heights
I'd rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder, makes me think
There's more to this, I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest, almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?

[Verse 4]
Can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist?
Well me, I'm neither
Wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there to have the proof?
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end?
In Heaven or in Hell?

Help me
Help me to find my true self without seeing the future
Save me
Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams, ow!

There's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance, another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again and again3Embed"
"Tears of a Clown Lyrics[Verse 1]
All alone in a crowded room
He tries to force a smile
The smile it beamed or so it seemed
But never reached the eyes, disguise
Masquerading as the funny man do they despise

The false smile maketh of the man
Glass empty or half full
Try to make some sense or sorrows drown
All looks well on the outside
Underneath the solemn truth
There’s something that inside has died

[Chorus]
Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he’s feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it’s all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown
[Verse 2]
Who motivates the motivator?
Facade it has to go
He knows it sooner or later
Smile for cameras all okay
But tomorrow is another day he must get through

He had a longer way to run
Or so the story goes
Life full of fun, where did it go?
We saw the sadness in his eyes
It came as no surprise
And now of course we’ll never know

[Chorus]
Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he’s feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it’s all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown

[Chorus]
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he’s feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it’s all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling down

Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds

In a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale

[Verse 2]
Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you about his years

[Verse 3]
Laying low in a blood filled trench
Killing time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again
[Verse 4]
In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all

[Verse 5]
Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon

[Verse 6]
Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin

[Chorus]
Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

[Post-Chorus]
The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go

Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops, they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen

Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to God no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale

Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still

Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go

Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die in Paschendale

Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death

As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again

Across the lines, beyond the hill

Have you heard, have you heard?

[Verse 2]
He sees them in the distance when the darkened clouds roll
He could feel tension in the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror, see an old man now
Does it matter they survive somehow?

[Verse 3]
They said there's nothing can be done about the situation
They said there's nothing we can do at all
To sit and wait around for something to occur
Did you know, did you know?
[Verse 4]
As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows
And wonders if they'll ever grow again
The desperation of the situation getting graver
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

[Verse 5]
Have you seen what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what they said about us all?
Do you know what is happening to just everyone of us?
Have you heard, have you heard?

[Verse 6]
There will be a catastrophe the like we’ve never seen
There will be something that will light the sky
That the world as we know it, it will never be the same
Did you know, did you know?

[Verse 7]
He carries everything into the shelter, not a fuss
Getting ready when the moment comes
He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
Good to have because you never know

[Verse 8]
They tell us nothing that we don't already know about
They tell us nothing that is real at all
They only fill us with the stuff that they want
Did you know, did you know?
[Verse 9]
He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day
He's getting tired, that'll do for now
They are preparing for the very worst to come to them
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

[Bridge]
He sees the picture on the wall
It's falling down upside down
He sees a teardrop from his wife
Roll down her face, saying grace
Remember times they had
They flash right through his mind, left behind
Of a lifetime spent together long ago will be gone

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 10]
They've been preparing for some weeks now
For when the crucial moment comes
To take their refuge in the shelter
Let them prepare for what will come

[Verse 11]
They make a tea and sit there waiting
They're in the shelter feeling snug
Not long to wait for absolution
Don't make a fuss just sit and wait
[Refrain]
I can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun
Can't you see it on the T.V.?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

[Verse 12]
Say a prayer when it's all over
Survivors, unite all as one
Got to try and help each other
Got the will to overcome

[Refrain]
I can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun
Can't you see it on the T.V.?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun
[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
When they found them
Had their arms wrapped around each other
Their tins of poison laying nearby their clothes
The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout
Just another when the wild wind blowsEmbed"
"Remember Tomorrow Lyrics[Verse 1]
Unchain the colours, before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return, from out of the... Oh!

Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, but this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the... Sky!

"Death of the Celts Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
The road it winds uphill all the way
Ride to glory on this day
Remember now to do him so proud
In God we trust, cry it out loud

[Verse 2]
Redeem my salve of winning ways
Remember all the darkest days
Of that I know will see me tread
Walketh upon the field of the dead

[Verse 3]
The burden of blood, the breaketh of bone
The battlefield now I make it my own
The glory of the morning we make
Praying the rose is still awake
[Verse 4]
Lord above my spirit says
Death is not proud, no more no less
Power of my soul will be free
Deliver us on to victory

[Verse 5]
Wither a pain that's almost a joy
Wander there my heart will destroy
Dreaming of days of our youth again
Stranger no wonder memories remain

[Verse 6]
Pour thy scorn upon the realm
Pity me none at the gates of our hell
For I am but a messenger, one
Sent to do reckoning what must be done

[Verse 7]
Praying to our wretched doom
Liberty freedom, maybe death looms
Wishing upon a fair display
Hoping our cause, done faithfully

[Verse 8]
Wayward thunder over rain
Giving me time to think again
Send to their graves on this day
Silent where the battle dead lay
[Verse 9]
Vengeance is for all who lay dead
I have no fear, my body has bled
I will live on in rebirth again
Come to me now, embrace it my friend

Spirits cry for a god from the grave
In darkness, fortune favours the brave

Immortal, for he will live evermore

Following now, the depths of despair
Beyond the light darkness will fall
Coming to take the life from us all

Falling now where God can’t explain
Bidding farewell, a lifeline again
Following those who came from hell
Came to witness the death of the CeltsEmbed"
"Lost in a Lost World Lyrics[Verse 1]
All is not it seems to be on the outside
Sometimes what appears to be is a show
What shows in the face is only a mirror
We all have some better places to go

[Verse 2]
We don't know just what we have ’til we've lost it
Until that time comes and know that it's gone
So hard to say things that we should have uttered long ago
Tear myself away from thoughts in my head

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
The people worshipping the sun
And all the children point up to the sky
They see the eagle as it floats on the wind
And they follow with their spirits high
[Verse 4]
Buffalo roam on the plain
We walk into the flames but dance for rain
The hallowed dead in sacred ground, the elders
And we wash away their sins for them

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the spirits of the old ones standing proud upon their race
And the testament to ancestors, that are never to retrace
Burn the flame of innocence, as they ride into the sun
Thinking now of our forefathers that are lying dead upon
Holy ground and sacred earth now
Revisit stolen youth

[Chorus 1]
Lost in a lost world
Buried on sacred ground
Lost in a lost world
Lying on sacred ground

Lost in a lost world
Buried on sacred ground

Lying on sacred ground

[Outro]
Will we ever heal our old wounds
Like forever darkness worn
Fighting for their lives again
So come on now don’t be afraid
This is where destiny lies
Just to let us breathe again
Put upon this earth to wander
And to walk, forever lost

With the ashes of our enemies
To live among our ghosts
Of our past fear nothing
Life is but a better path to joy
Nowhere to go, nowhere to run
Our whole nation overrun
Itself existence under threat
And soon will be none of us left

Remember names of all our dead now
And enemies that fled
Reaching for our sky forever free
A sadness that is proud
As the clouds all drift away now
Until we meet againEmbed"
"Wrathchild Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was born into a scene of angriness and greed
Dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen, my dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be

For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching

[Verse 1]
The only place where you can dream
Living here is not what it seems
Ship of white light in the sky
Nobody there to reason why
Here I am, I'm not really there
Smiling faces ever so rare
Let's walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the place

[Verse 2]
Stalks of light come from the ground

Shades of green grasses twine
Girls drinking plasma wine
A look at love, a dream unfolds
Living here, you'll never grow old

The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed
Time, it waits for no man
My future it is revealed
Time, it waits for no man
My fate is sealed

Fly in the face of your prophets, I mock your morality plays

Some innocent pawn in an endgame, one more stalemate

A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us
And look through our eyes?

Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin, does it measure up to your lust?
So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So until the next time

Can't you see them? It's plain for all to see
They were there, oh I know you don't believe me

Oh, I've never felt so strange
But I'm not going insane

Another time, another place
A hollow universe in space
I took a trip to see the sights
I will be blacker than the night

Let's shoot the moon, you and me

Shootin' plasma from my grave

I’m not particular at night
A single particle of me
You won’t be tracking me by sight

He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow
He rules the sandworms and the Fremen
In a land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow
He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
In the land called planet Dune
Body water is your life
And without it that you would die
In the desert the planet Dune, oh!

Without a still suit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis
It is a land that's rich in spice
The sand riders and the mice
That they call the 'Muad'Dib'
He is the Kwizatz Haderach
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar
He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars

As a young boy chasing dragons
With your wooden sword so mighty
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast
Times change very quickly, and you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet

You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour

The smell of resined leather, the steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew to fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the screams of evil men

As the compass swings, my will is strong
I will not be led astray

Mysteries of time, clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know

As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea

Nothing's real until you feel

The sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm
Blood surging with the strain

"Stranger in a Strange Land Lyrics[Verse 1]

Home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
But now it seems to me
That all is lost and nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem

My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends
From home discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me

Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no trace

Land of ice and snow
Trapped into this prison, yea

And men again they came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying
Where it fell on that day
Preserved in time for all to see

Lost in this place, and leave no trace

Follow me now to a place we begin
Wrought with no anger, wrought with no fear
Devilish children playing here
Hidden in silence, below barren waste
Confusion hunger, am I still awake?

Have I ever told you about my time machine
Sit you down I'll tell you everywhere I've been
I have lived a long life, life extraordinaire
Let me tell you about it, let me take you there
Does it really matter, it's all in the mind
Let me tell you about it, listen what you'll find

You cannot imagine what I've seen and done

Stand among the steeples, stand upon the walls

I have seen the gods cry, howling in the wind
Where do I get started, when can I begin

Tough of the track with the wind
And the rain that's beating down on your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more
Till the sound is ringing in your head
With every step you tread
And every breath you take

Determination makes you run, never stop
Gotta win, gotta run till you drop
Keep the pace, hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer
You're over halfway there
But the miles, they never seem to end
As if you're in a dream, not getting anywhere
It seems so futile

Run, on and on
Run, on and on

Run over stiles, across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer
But do you want the glory that goes?
You reach the final stretch
Ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile

I remember it as plain as day
Although it happened in the dark of the night
I was strolling through the streets of Paris
And it was cold it was starting to rain
And then I heard a piercing scream
And I rushed to the scene of the crime
But all I found was the butchered remains
Of two girls lay side by side

Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Flee before the killers go free

There's some people coming down the street
At last someone heard my call
Can't understand why they're pointing at me
I never done nothing at all
But I got some blood on my hands
Because everyone's shouting at me
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
And like a fool I started running away

Someone call the Gendarmes

Where the two young victims died
If I could go to somebody for help
To get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that it's on my mind
That my doctor said I've done it before

This isn't real, this is only a dream

Is it now could it be that the angel
Of death has come for me?

Is this the place where the living join the dead?

Longboats have been sighted
And the evidence of war has begun
Many Nordic fighting men
Their swords and shields gleam in the sun
Call to arms, defend yourselves
Get ready to stand and fight for your lives

So be prepared, don't run, stand your ground

They've come, the enemy
Beneath the blazing sun
The battle has to be won

Warning must be given and there's not enough men here for a stand

They've come to attack
They're coming in for the kill

You'd better get away

"The Great Unknown LyricsWinter softly falling to the ground
Calmly waiting don’t you hear a sound
When the world has fallen to the depths below
Where the future’s open and the fear has grown
And the path to follow to the great unknown
Where the dark has fallen and the seed is sown
In the selfish hearts of some
The nightmare’s coming
With the spilling blood of others
Now wringing through
Now the cup is spilling over
Wake to news of death
And the prophecy of sages
Destiny is met
To the depths of human mind
The cry is burning
With the mentor’s anger
Of the lesson ringing true
And for those who live by and are dying by the sword
They will take their ideals with them
Justify their end

Where the fools are lying and the meek are crying
Where the wolves are preying
On the weak alone
Where the sons are dying
Hear their mothers crying
And the distant sound of fire

Have I dreamt this time, this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face
Seen this room, been in this place

Am I still inside my dream?

Coming to the realisation

Got to keep myself from drifting

"The Man of Sorrows LyricsLike a man without a home
Watching people come and go
Carry on their daily lives
Without a thought for the ones alone

Cast the dream aside like throwing
A pebble into the ocean tide
And I’m feeling so alone again

Free the angry from their pain
Free the captives from the chains
Cast aside the doubt that
Nothing good can come their way again

Living in a world of lies
No matter how or hard we try
Living life without a dream today
Looking through a mist of truth
That we believe an elusive cloud
The things we find are hard to say now
That we live through day to day
Find it hard to force the reasons
Why we find it hard to die

Now we need to know the truth now
Open our eyes that we can see
So we live and breathe again
Better days for you and me
Can we even hope to deliver this
We are so far away

As one turns against the other
With a brother against brother
Situation like no other it’s a picture of despair

As we look to see the man of sorrows
Passing knowledge to those who don’t know
As we watch all our friends passing over
As they pass through the edges of time
And we see what’s ahead that awaits us
That no longer do we feel afraid
So we look to see the man of sorrows
And the light is the darkness no more

She must be having one of her crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
It made her feel like she's on cloud nine

But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the Devil's bend
The Beast and Charlotte, they were two of a kind
They'd always take the line from here to eternity

"Different World Lyrics[Verse 1]
You lead me on the path, keep showing me the way
I feel a little lost, a little strange today
I think I'll take a hold of whatever comes my way
Then we'll see what happens, take it day-by-day

[Verse 2]
I thought I had it all, I had it all worked out
Just what the future held, that there would be no doubt
But then the card came up and I took another turn
But I don't know if it's fulfillment that I yearn

[Chorus]
Tell me what you can hear
And then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way
To view the world
I would like you to know
When you see the simple things
To appreciate this life
It's not too late to learn

Don't wanna be here
Somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there
I might find it's not for me

Believe in me and send no money
I died on the cross, that ain't funny
But my so called friends they're making me a joke
They missed out what I said like I never spoke

They choose what they wanna hear, don't tell a lie
They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die
Saving your soul by taking your money
Flies around shit, bees around honey

There's plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work making holy smoke, yeah

Say they gonna be with you at the end
Burning records, burning books

I've lived in filth, I've lived in sin
And I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in

They can have a Lincoln for their bed
Friend of the president, trick of the tail
Now they ain't got a prayer, 100 years in jail

"No More Lies Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a darkened sky before me
There's no time to prepare
Salvage a last horizon
But no regrets from me
Maybe I'll be back some other day
To live again just who can say
In what shape or form that I might be
Just another chance for me
A hurried time no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusion
And wishing all my life away
No-one can stop me now
Time is up it couldn't last
But there's more things I'd like to do
I'm coming back to try again
Someday maybe I'll wait till then

Talking tall and drinking wine
Their time is up just like me
But they just don't know it yet
So just a word of warning
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from
I've got my eye on you
The clock is fast, the hour is near
Eventful past is ever clear
My life is set, the time is here
I think I'm coming home

Combat red in tooth and claw
Ready now for one more score

Outside you will fear my name

I kill to quench my thirst
I hunt the weakest prey
Live to fly another day

"The Longest Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the gloom, the gathering storm abates
In the ships, gimlet eyes await
The call to arms to hammer at the gates
To blow them wide, throw evil to its fate

All summers long, the drills to build the machine
To turn men from flesh and blood to steel
From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach
From summer sands to Armageddon´s reach

Overlord, your master, not your God
The enemy coast dawning grey with scud
These wretched souls, puking, shaking fear
To take a bullet for those who sent them here
The world's alight
The cliffs erupt in flame
No escape, remorseless shrapnel rains
Drowning men, no chance for a warrior's fate
A choking death, enter Hell's gates

[Pre-Chorus]
Sliding we go
Only fear on our side
To the edge of the wire
And we rush with the tide
Oh, the water is red
With the blood of the dead
But I'm still alive
Pray to God I survive

How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
[Verse 2]
The rising dead, faces bloated, torn
They are relieved, the living wait their turn
Your number's up, the bullet's got your name
You still go on to Hell and back again

Valhalla waits
Valkyries rise and fall
The warrior tombs lie open for us all
A ghostly hand reaches through the veil
Blood and sand, we will prevail

[Pre-Chorus]
Sliding we go
Only fear on our side
To the edge of the wire
And we rush with the tide
Oh, the water is red
With the blood of the dead
But I'm still alive
Pray to God I survive

Mother Russia, how are you sleeping?
Middle winter cold winds blow
From the trees the snowflakes drifting
Swirling 'round like ghosts in the snow

Tells the tale of a great empire
Turning 'round, the old man ponders
Reminiscing an age gone by

Hold up your heads, be proud of what you are
Now it has come, freedom at last

Can you release the anger, the grief?
Can you be happy now your people are free?2Embed"

Let me tell you about my life
Let me tell you about my dreams
Let me tell you about the things that happened
Always real to me

Let me tell you of my hope
Of my need to reach the sky
Let me take you on an awkward journey
Let me tell you why
Let me tell you why

[Verse 1]
Why should these curses be laid upon me?
I won't be forgiven 'till I can break free
What did I do to deserve all this guilt?
Paid for my sins, for the sale of my soul
Demons are trapped all inside of my head
My hopes are gone, reach for Heaven from Hell

My sins are many
My guilt is too heavy
The pressure of knowing
Of hiding what I know

I'm able to see things
Things I don't want to see
The lives of a thousand souls
Weigh heavy down on me

I know they're crying for help, reaching out
The burden of them will take me down as well
The sin of a thousand souls not died in vain
Reincarnation of me
Live again

Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation
To exorcise this Hell

Something to save me from myself

"Virus LyricsThere's an evil virus that's threatening mankind
Not state of the art, a serious state of the mind
The muggers, the back stabbers, the two faced elite
A menace to society, a social disease

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one upmanship order
Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray
Eating away at your own self esteem
Pouncing on every word that you might be saying

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order
Superficially smiling a shake of the hand
As soon as the back is turned, treachery is planned

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order

Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray

When every good thing's laid to waste
By all the jealousy and hate
By all the acid, wit and rapier lies
And every time you think you're safe
And when you go to turn away
You know they're sharpening all their papers knives

All in your mind, all in your head, try to relate it
All in your mind, all in your head, try to escape it

Without a conscience they destroy
And that's a thing that they enjoy
They're a sickness that's in all our minds
They want to sink the ship and leave
The way they laugh at you and me
You know it happens all the time
All in your mind, all in your head, try to relate it
All in your mind, all in your head, try to escape it, yeah

I just want to live my own fantasy
Fate has brought us to these shores
What was meant to be is now happening

I've found that I like this living in danger
Living on edge it feels, it makes us feel as one
Who cares now what's right or wrong
It's reality
Killing so we survive
Wherever we may roam
Wherever we may hide
We've got to get away

I don't want existence to end
We must prepare ourselves for the elements
I just want to feel like we're strong
We don't need a code of morality
I like all the mixed emotion and anger
It brings out the animal the power you can feel
And feeling so high with this much adrenalin
Excited but scary to believe what we've become

[Verse 1]
Wandering aimlessly in a cold dark mist I follow
Walking in a dark world that’s been
Kissed with sadness
Without sunlight things are born
To the dead of nightmares
Soulless demons laughing in a sea of madness

Listen closely to the raven’s call
Praying hard for our world not to end
Try as might to make sense of it all
Will it be for the penance of men
Follow north for the call of the wild
Look all out for a small wayward child
Lay in fear as the dark raven crows
Look for guidance from the one who knows
He lived on this earth for a time and a half
Playing a tune to the old man’s laugh
The fear that’s inside the men of the oath
In the script of the book that he wrote
[Chorus]
Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

[Verse 2]
As the raven again passes by
I can hear all the wake fathers cry
That the first born of all men will die
That their lives will be taken from them
Face the danger a battle of wills
Strength and courage a cure for all ills
We believe in that thou shall not kill
But others are ready to spill

[Bridge]
The hearts of all men since beginning of time
Living with temptation
Wanting and crime
A walk in the shadow of the valley of death
Knowing I’ll take my last breath
[Chorus]
Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

[Bridge]
The hearts of all men since beginning of time
Living with temptation
Wanting and crime
A walk in the shadow of the valley of death
Knowing I’ll take my last breath

[Chorus]
Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin
[Verse 3]
Into the valley of death fear no evil
We will go forward no matter the cost
Into the valley of death follow me now
Bring me your souls and I’ll make it our last

[Chorus]
Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin4Embed"
"The Thin Line Between Love and Hate Lyrics[Verse 1]
When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any costs
At what price life is lost

At what point do we begin?
Fighter spirit, will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road?

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes
[Verse 2]
We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
Sometimes takes just more than that
To survive, be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what, we'll never change

[Chorus]
I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

[Verse 3]
Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane
At what age begin to learn of what way out we will turn?
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes
[Chorus]
I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

"No Prayer for the Dying Lyrics[Verse 1]
There are times when I've wondered
And times when I've cried
When my prayers, they were answered
At times when I've lied
But if you asked me a question
Would I tell you the truth?
Now there's something to bet on
You've got nothing to lose, yeah

[Verse 2]
When I've sat by the window
And gazed at the rain
With an ache in my heart
But never feeling the pain
And if you would tell me
Just what my life means
Walking a long road
Never reaching the end

"Coming Home LyricsWhen I stand before you shining in the early morning sun
When I feel the engines roar and I think of what we've done
Oh, the bittersweet reflection as we kiss the earth goodbye
As the waves and echoes of the towns become the ghosts of time

[Chorus 1]
Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes
No creed and no religion just a hundred winged souls
We will ride this Thunderbird, silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away, our land of birth

[Chorus 2]
To Albion's land, Coming home
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay
Curving on the edge of daylight
Til it slips into the void
Waited in the long night
Dreaming til the sun is born again
Stretched the fingers of my hand, covered countries with my span
Just a lonely satellite, speck of dust and cosmic sand

[Chorus 1]
Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes
Flown the dark Atlantic over mariners' stormy graves
We will ride this Thunderbird, silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away, our land of birth

[Chorus 2]
To Albion's land, Coming home
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay
To Albion's land, Coming home
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay
Coming home, far away when I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align

"Sea of Madness Lyrics[Verse 1]
Out in the street somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return

Oh, my eyes, they see but I can't believe
Oh, my heart is heavy
As I turn my back and leave

Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness

Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling
Out in the dark there burns a dream
You got to hope when you are falling
To find the world that you have seen

"The Talisman LyricsWhen I stand and look about the port
And contemplate my life
Will I ever see my countrymen again?

As the captain calls us on the deck
I take my things and walk
To the harbour side
I glance back one last time

Fleeing our nation, our problems we leave behind
Ships by the tenfold sail out on the tide
We are pleased to be out and embracing the open sea
Free from our troubles and more free from thee

Inheritors unfulfilled reason behind us
We flee from what is not, what is will be
We flee the earth and face our harsh reality
Will death be low mist that hangs on the sea?
We run from evil tongues
Rash judgements, selfish men
Never to be seen on these shores again

As we sail into ocean size
And lose sight of land
Face of contentment around in the air
We're off now to seek all our fortunes
To the land of our dreams....

Riding the waves and the storm is upon us
The winds lash the sails
But the ropes keep them tight
Off in the distance a dark cloud approaching
None could imagine what there was to come

No, there's no-one going back
No, there's not a second chance
As we strap onto the side
We pray to God that we won't die

As we ride the rough seas
As we soak from the ocean waves
I just hope for all our lives
And pray that I survive
Four ships are lost in the stormy conditions
The spirits of the sunken crews
Their phantoms follow us

Spirits sails, they drive us on
Through the all-consuming waves
Cold mortality, no weapon
Against these ever raging seas

Four leagues and ten and we hit storms again
We just can't get away from the eye of the storm
The birds outsoar the raging storm
But we cannot escape it
Abandoned earth, that we now crave
Is many leagues from save

Holding on for our dear lives
And we're praying once again
Rotten luck or just jonahed?
The talisman is in my hand

Limbs fatigue, trembling with cold
Blinded from the sea spray salt
Clasping anything we can hold
Heaven's rain upon us falls
Twenty days without a meal
And ten without fresh water still
Those that didn't die in storms
The scurvy rest did slaughter

[Chorus]
Westward the tide
Westward we sail on
Westward the tide
Sail by the talisman

We approach the other side
Of the ocean with the tide
In our favour just for once
Welcome greeting our new land
The elation in our hearts
The excitement in our veins
As we sail towards the coastline
Of our golden promised land

Weary limbs fatigued away
I have no life left in me
No more strength
No nothing left to give
Must find the will to live

Never thought that we could make it
Truly sight of shores divine
The sickness I am dying from
Never wanted it to end this way

"The Legacy Lyrics[Intro]
Tell you a thing that you ought to know
Two minutes of your time, then on you go
Tell tale of the men all dressed in black
That most of them, not coming back
Sent off to war to play little games
And on their return, can't name no names
Some strange yellow gas has played with their minds
Has reddened their eyes, removed all the lies
And strange as it sounds, death knows no bounds
How many get well?
Only time will tell
Only time will tell

[Verse 1]
You lie in your death bed now
But what did you bring to the table?
Brought us only holy sin
Utter trust is a deadly thing
To the prayer of holy peace
We didn't know what was lying underneath
So how could we be such fools?
And to think that we thought you the answer
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't begin to understand in all the lies
But on your death bed, I can see it in your eyes
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow
It really makes sense, I can really see it clearly now

[Verse 2]
Tangled up in a web of lies
Could have been a way to prophesize
Unaware of the consequence
Not aware of the secrets that you kept
Nothing that we could believe
To reveal the facade of faceless men
Not a thing that we could foresee
Now a sign that would tell us the outcome

[Pre-Chorus]
You had us all strung out with promises of peace
But all along, your cover plan was to deceive
Can it put to rights now?
Only time will tell
Your prophecies will send us all to Hell as well

[Chorus]
Left to all our golden sons
All to pick up on the peace
You could have given all of them
A little chance, at least
Take the world to better place
Given them all just a little hope
Just think what a legacy you now will leave
[Solo]

[Outro]
We seemed destined to live in fear
And some that would say Armageddon is near
But where there's a life, while there's hope
That man won't self-destruct
Why can't we treat our fellow men
With more respect and a shake of their hands?
But anger and loathing is rife
The death on all sides is becoming a way of life
We live in an uncertain world
Fear, understanding and ignorance is leading to death
Only the corpses are left
For vultures that prey on their bones

But some are just not wanting peace
Their whole life is death and misery
The only thing that they know;
""Fight fire with fire, life is cheap""
But if they do stop to think
That man is teetering right on the brink
But do you think that they care?
They benefit from death and pain and despairEmbed"
"El Dorado Lyrics[Verse 1]
Got to tell you a story
On a cold winter's night
You'll be sailing for glory
Before you know what is right
So come over here now
I got a vision for you
It's my personal snake oil
It's just something I do

[Verse 2]
I'm the jester with no tears
And I'm playing on your fears
I'm a trickster smiling underneath
This mask of love and death
The eternal lie I've told
About the pyramids of gold
I've got you hooked at every turn
Your money's left to burn
(Hahahaha...)

[Verse 3]
You'll be wanting a contract, ha!
You'll be waiting awhile
I'd like to give you my contact
But that isn't my style
Well you only get one chance
And it's too good to miss
If I didn't lie to you
Then I wouldn't exist

[Verse 4]
Greed, lust and envy pride
It's the same old same old ride
The smoke and mirrors visions
That you see are just like me
I'm a clever banker's face
With just a letter out of place
I know someone just like you
Knows someone just like me

El Dorado, step this way
Take a ticket for the ride

See my ship is oversold

So gone is the glory
And gone is the gold
Well if you knew the story
How come it has to be told
Well you can say I'm a devil
And I wouldn't say no
But out here on the dark side
Hey! on with the show

[Verse 6]
So then my tale is told
Big and bad and twice as bold
This ship of fools is sinking
As the cracks begin to grow
There is no easy way
For an honest man today
Which is something you should think of
As my lifeboat sails away

You see it in their faces
The sadness in their tears

Madness and the fear

"When the River Runs Deep Lyrics[Intro]
Look for something that is hard to find
Searching somewhere deep inside your mind
Hope you find just what you’re looking for
Heaven’s waiting with an open door

[Verse 1]
If you should sell your soul as cheaply as I did then
The road to ruin is a long road to hide in
We signed our lives away to have an escape
It’s something that will be whatever our fate

[Bridge]
There’s no use in hiding
Got to keep on trying
Can’t take no more lying
This is the last
There’s no time for crying
When some of us are dying
None of us decide what is our fate
[Chorus]
Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their side
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives

[Verse 2]
Is this the last together maybe this time now
We stand together and we’re holding the line here
There’s nothing we can do just sit here and wait
The die is cast that is deciding our fate

There’s no use in hiding
Got to keep on trying
Can’t take no more lying
This is the last
There’s no time for crying

Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives
Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives

Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep

I try to call the Earth's command
Desperation in my voice
I'm drifting way off course now
With very little choice
The loneliness is hard to bear
I try to calm my fear
Just hoping any second now
Some contact filters through

Desperate calls
Signal back from satellite
As my life
Flashes right in front of me
Try again

I'm lost without trace

Too close to the sun
I surely will burn
Like Icarus before me or so legend goes

I think of my life
Reliving my past
There's nothing but wait till my time comes
I've had a good life
I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back some time afresh

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them one last goodbye

If I could survive
To live one more time
I wouldn't be changing a thing at all
Done more in my life
Than some do in ten
I'd go back and do it all over again

I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them one last goodbye

There isn't much time
Must say my last rites
Nobody is here to read them to me
Must say my goodbyes
If only a line
A message to tell them in case they might find

I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them one last goodbye

"Quest for Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam
Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
To save the power of warmth and light

[Chorus]
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man
[Verse 2]
And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone
So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of light and heat

[Chorus]
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man

"Another Life Lyrics[Drum Intro]

[Verse 1]
As I lay here lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is, I want to know
Please, won't you tell me? It's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away, yeah
But I'm so tired of living
I might as well end today

As I lay here lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is, I want to know

But I'm so tired of living

"Lord of Light Lyrics[Intro]
There are secrets that you keep
There are secrets that you keep
There are secrets that you tell to me alone
I can't reach things I can't see
You don't see this strange world quite the same as me
Don't deny me what I am
Nothing hidden, still you fail to see the truth
These are things you can't reveal
These are things you can't reveal

[Verse 1]
We are part of some strange plan
Why the slaughter of the brotherhood of man?
Infernal sacrifice of Hell
Fire breathing, lead the way
Mounds of bodies, as they all burn into one
Revenge is living in the past
Time to look into a new millennium
[Verse 2]
Spiral path leads through the maze
Down into the fiery underworld below
Fire breathing, lead the way
Lucifer was just an Angel led astray

[Chorus]
Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries
Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries

[Bridge 1]
We are not worthy in your black and blazing eyes
We gather demons in the mirror every day
The bridge of darkness casts a shadow on us all
And all our sins, to you, we give, this day
Others wait their turn, their lives were meant to last
Use yours wisely, as the light is fading fast
Free your soul and let it fly
Mine was caught, I couldn't try
Time returns again to punish all of us
[Bridge 2]
We are cast out by our bloody Father's hand
We are strangers in this lonely promised land
We are the shadows of the one unholy ghost
In our nightmare world, the only one we trust
[Solo]

[Chorus]
Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries
Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries2Embed"
"Journeyman Lyrics[Verse 1]
From the red sky of the east
To the sunset in the west
We have cheated death and he has cheated us
But that was just a dream
And this is what it means
We are sleeping and we'll dream forevermore

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows we made with our hands
Deeper grey, came to mourn
All the colours of the dawn
Will this journeyman's day be his last?

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away

[Verse 2]
But the memory still remains
All the past years, not so strange
Our winter times are like a silent shroud
And the heartbeat of the day
Drives the mist away
And winter's not the only dream around

[Pre-Chorus 2]
In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then your journeyman's day has begun

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want

"Deja-Vu Lyrics[Instrumental Intro 0:00-1:02]

[Verse 1]
When you see familiar faces
But you don't remember where they're from
Could you be wrong?
When you've been particular places
That you know you've never been before
Can you be sure?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you know this has happened before
And you know that this moment
In time is for real
And you know when you feel deja-vu

Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before

Ever had a conversation
That you realize you've had before?
Isn't it strange?
Have you ever talked to someone
And you feel you know what's coming next?
It feels pre-arranged

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you know that you've heard it before
And you feel that this moment
In time is surreal
'Cause you know when you feel deja-vu

Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before but I know how it feels

I met up with a stranger last night to keep me alive
He spends all his money on gambling and guns to survive

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law

So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law

Cold as steel, the darkness waits its hour will come
A cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun
Mother nature's black revenge on those who waste her life
War babies in the garden of Eden shall turn our ashes to ice

Sunrise has gone
Freezing up the fires
Sunrise has gone
Numbing our desires
Sunrise has gone

A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas, there's nowhere left to run
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane

Freezing up the fires
Sunrise has gone
Numbing our desires

For some wise word from their leading light
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools
""Is this the end?"" the millions cried
Clutching their riches as they died
Those who survive must weather the storm

Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No one's certain what your future will behold

Nomad, rider that men know the least

Nomad, where you go to no one tells

Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things, but no one's seen you kill

Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius

Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own

Take my eyes, the things I've seen
In this world coming to an end
My reflection fades, I'm weary
Of these earthly bones and skin
You may pass through me and
Leave no trace, I have no mortal face
Solar winds are whispering
You may hear me call

[Verse 2]
We can shed our skins and swim
Into the darkened void beyond
We will dance among the world
That orbit stars that aren't our sun
All the oxygen that trapped us
In a carbon spider's web
Solar winds are whispering
You may hear the sirens of the dead
[Verse 3]
Let the elders to their parley
Meant to satisfy our lust
Leaving Damocles still hanging
Over all their promised trust
Walk away from freedoms
Offered by the jailers in their cage
Step into the light
Star tripping over mortals in their rage

[Chorus]
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are with the Goddess of the sun tonight

[Verse 4]
The preacher loses face with Christ
Religion's cruel device is gone
Empty flesh and hallowed bones
Make pacts of love, but die alone
The crucible of pain will forge
The blanks of sin, begin again
You are free to choose a life to live
Or one that's left to lose
[Verse 5]
Virgins in the teeth of God
Are meat and drink to feed the damned
You may pass through me
And I will feel the life that you live less
Step into my light star tripping
We will rage against the night
Walk away from comfort
Offered by your citizens of death

[Chorus]
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are one with the Goddess of the sun tonight

[Verse 6]
Take my eyes for what I've seen
I will give my sight to you
You are free to choose
Whatever life to live or life to lose
Whatever God you know
He knows you better than you believe
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived
[Verse 7]
Look into our face reflected
In the moon glow in your eyes
Remember you can choose to look
But not to see and waste your hours
You believe you have the time
But I tell you your time is short
See your past and future
All the same and it cannot be bought

[Chorus]
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are one with the Goddess of the sun tonight

[Verse 6 - Reprise]
Take my eyes for what I've seen
I will give my sight to you
You are free to choose
Whatever life to live or life to lose
Whatever God you know
He knows you better than you believe
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived

[Verse 4 - Reprise]
The preacher loses face with Christ
Religion's cruel device is gone
Empty flesh and hallowed bones
Make pacts of love, but die alone
The crucible of pain will forge
The blanks of sin, begin again

"Como Estais Amigos Lyrics[Verse 1]
Como está, amigo?
For the death of those we don't know
Shall we kneel and say a prayer?
They will never know we care

[Bridge]
Shall we keep the fires burning?
Shall we keep the flames alive?
Should we try to remember
What is wrong and what is right?

[Chorus]
No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos, no more tears
Oh, oh
[Verse 2]
And if we do forget them
And the sacrifice they made
Will the wickedness and sadness
Come to visit us again?

[Bridge]
Shall we dance a dance in sunlight?
Shall we drink the wine of peace?
Shall our tears be of joy?
Shall we keep at bay the beast?

[Chorus]
No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos, no more tears
Oh, oh, oh

Inside it must remain
No victory and no vanquished
Only horror, only pain

Amigos, no more tears
Oh, oh, oh

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years

"The Man Who Would Be King Lyrics[Verse 1]
As he travels on the beast of burden
Moving up along the mountainside
As he gazes looking down the valley
No regrets but his pride
As he journeys across mountain passes
Insignificance sweeps over him
His reflection of the beauty 'round him
Feeling empty inside
He is running from his wildest thoughts
He is running from his everything
He is looking now to find something
Hoping he could be saved

[Verse 2]
He's searching for the answer now
It's something that he's managed to avoid up to now
Real conviction that he craves
He needs to find the answer sooner than later
Pushed himself to the limits
He had to strive for all the harder things in life
But what the cost to give in now?
His life, his time are the only things that he has
[Bridge]
Life is not a rehearsal
All he has is the one chance to get it right
Leaving really is the only way to know
Maybe one day they'll forgive him what he's done
But now the pain of lying too early in the grave

[Chorus]
Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now will be his saving grace

[Instrumental Break: 3:57-5:32]

[Verse 3]
He tries to make his peace with God
All is forgivable but it's left a little late
Trying something that he's not
Is it possible to change such a lot?
He's taken someone's life away
There's not a day goes by he regrets what he's done
He should have found another way
But the good book says: ""An eye for an eye""
In reflecting on decisions that were made
On the judgements that will haunt him till his grave
No one has the right to take another life
But in his mind he had no choice, so be it
[Chorus][x2]
Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now will be his saving grace

[Outro]
Far, far away, the man who would be king
Far, far away, the man who would be king
So far away, the man who would be king
So far away, the man who would be king

"The Alchemist LyricsStranger than the comet as it streaks across the sky
Stranger than the truth I know before my open eyes
I have dealt in mysteries and trickery of light to entertain
Looked into the abyss, called it by its name
I have plundered time itself, put the world inside it
I'm the mysteries, day and night, divide it
A plague of wonders, on your knees beside me
Know the secrets, you shall not deride us
My dreams of empire from my frozen queen
Will come to pass
Know me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee
And this is my house

I am the master of the tides
I shame the mirror in my sight
What random music of the spheres
Across the years
[Chorus]
Know this
I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain up the demons set free
Strange alchemy

Gather round the aimless and the feckless and the lame
Hear the master summon up the spirits by their names
I curse you Edward Kelley, your betrayal for eternity is damned
Know you speak with demons, you cannot command

Even as I looked into the glass then I was blinded
Burning by the Mortlake shore my house, my books inside it
You have taken up my wife and lain beside her
Now the black rain on my house, the timbers burning
My dreams of empire from my frozen queen
Will come to pass
Know me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee
And this was my house
I was the keeper of the books
I had the knowledge of the scrolls
But now through ignorance and fear
I cast a shadow through the years
Know this, I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain up the demons set free
Strange alchemy

[Instrumental Break: 3:06-3:52]

Know this, I will return to this land

"Montségur Lyrics[Verse 1]
I stand alone in this desolate space
In death they are truly alive
Massacred innocents, evil took place
The Angels were burning inside
Centuries later I wonder why
What secret that they took to their grave
Still burning heretics under our skies
Religion still burning inside

[Chorus]
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
[Post-Chorus 1]
As we kill them all so God will know his own
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross
Templar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
To stand with the Cathars to die and be free

[Verse 2]
The book of Old Testament crippled and black
Satan his weapon is lust
Living this evil damnation of flesh
Back to the torture of life
The perfect would willingly have died at the stake
And all of their followers slain
As for the knowledge of god they had claimed
Religion still burning inside

[Chorus]
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel

Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
Still burning heretics under our skies

[Post-Chorus 3]
As we kill them all so God will know his own
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
No passover feast for the cursed within
Facing the sun as they went to their grave
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave
Death is the price for your soul's liberty
To stand with the Cathars and to die and be free

The keys to death and Hell
The ailing kingdom, doomed to fail
The bonds of sin and heart will break
Of Heaven's course, we'll take
Quelling the Devil's might
And ready for eternal fight
Aching limbs and fainting soul
Heavy battles take their toll

So, to you we bid farewell

Deliver good from ill
Clean the water, clean our guilt
With us do what you will
Then will my judge appear
Bear no false Angels that I hear
For, only then, I will confess
To my eternal Hell

Now give us our holy sign

Pay to kill, die to lose

To make trophies out of men

Lose your skin, lose your skull
One by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate
Know which breath will be your last

"Mother of Mercy LyricsSitting, waiting in the falling rain
Getting ready to begin again
Wounded lying, crying
Bodies moving, dying
All around there is the smell of death and fire

Here the planes are coming
Hear the soldiers running
Killing on a scale to comprehend

Why are we here?
In this place, here to kill
Please God, forgive us for what we have done
I always thought I was doing right
As of now I'm not feeling so sure
I'm at a place where I give no grace
I'm a soldier of war
I sit waiting for my darkest hour to come
I cannot think about the things that I have done
It shouldn't take a fool to see that I believe
Accept the consequence, repent for what I've done

You tell me what is certain
But I'll tell you what is true
You tell me what is honesty
When all around is death and cruelty

The making of man is fire
Not giving in to our desires
Within the truth that lies
Within the only thing

[Chorus]
Mother of mercy
Angel of death desire
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy
Angel of pain
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath
Some say you are a lost cause
Some say you're a saint
Just being here's an act of suffering and restraint
Walk down the long dark road to ruin and panic not
I'll die a lonely death, of that I'm certain of
Rivers flow with blood
There's nowhere left to hide
It's hard to comprehend there's anyone left alive
Sick of all the killing and the reek of death
Will God tell me what religion is to man?
I don't hold with bad religion
Understand what's underneath it
Now I come to think of it
I just don't hold at all, you know it
You say you are a holy man
But what is it you do?
From where I stand is nothing
But a hollow man I see

[Chorus w/variation]
Mother of mercy
Angel of Death, desire
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy
Angel of pain
Mother of mercy
Drawing my last breath
I'm just a lonely soldier
Fighting in a bloody hopeless war
Don't know what I'm fighting
Who it is, or what I'm fighting for
Thought it was for money
Make my fortune, now I'm not so sure
Seem to just have lost my way1Embed"
"Isle of Avalon LyricsI can hear them floating on the wind
Immortal souls, their weeping saddens me
Mother earth, you know your time is near
Awaken lust, the seed is sown and reaped

Through the western isle
I hear the dead awaken
Rising slowly to the court of Avalon
The cauldron of the head of Annwyn laced with envy
Dark around its edge with pearl and destiny

All my days I've waited for the sign
The one that brings me closer to the isle of Avalon
I can feel the power flowing through my veins
My heart is beating louder close to Avalon

I can hear you
Can you hear me?
I can feel you
Can't you feel me?

Fertility Mother Goddess
Celebration, sow the seeds of the born
The fruit of her body laden
Through the corn doll
You will pray for them all
The image of Mother Goddess
Lying dormant, in the eyes of the dead
The sheaf of the corn is broken
End the harvest
Throw the dead on the pyre

[Chorus]
I hear her crying the tears of an angel
The voices I hear in my head
Blessed the fruits are the corn of the earth
Mother earth, holy blood of the dead

Mother earth
I can hear you
Sacrifice
Now united

Rising levels of the tidal lakes protect them
Keepers of the Goddess in the underworld
Holding powers of the mystics, deep inside them
Nineteen maidens, guardians of the Otherworld

Mortal conflict
Born of Celtic legend
That apart from seven
None returned from Avalon

Mother earth
I can feel you
My rebirth
Now completed

[Pre-Chorus]

To have the belief of others
Looking for the isle to show them a sign
Fertility of all mothers
Stood in silence waiting now for their turn
The gateway to Avalon
The island where the souls of the dead are reborn
Brought here to die and be transferred into the earth
And then for rebirth

[Chorus]

The water in rivers and rhymes rises quickly
Are flowing and flooding the land
The sea shall return once again just to hide them
Lost souls on the isle of the deadEmbed"

Everybody's waiting for something to happen
Everybody's waiting for something to see
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters

Winding lives at the end of the spiral
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill
Everyone's looking but no one is listening
Everybody wants to be in at the kill

I see the signs of the end time

Everyone's looking at death from the sky
Everyone's nightmares are going to happen

Everyone's praying but no one's believing
Everybody's heroes tell everyone's lies

"The Angel and the Gambler LyricsRoll of the dice, take a spin of the wheel
Out of your hands now, so how do you feel?
But you're not gonna win
You'd better go back again

Do you feel lucky or do you feel scared?
Take what luck brings and the Devil may care
But you're down on your luck
And what will the next day bring?

Adrift on the ocean
Afloat in a daydream
Or lost in a maze
Or blind in the haze

So what does it matter?
So why don't you answer?
So why did you send
An angel to mend?
Best make decisions, before it's too late
Take all your chances, take hold of the reigns
A roll of the dice
Ahead of the game again

Nothing to lose, but so much to gain
A little danger, it goes without saying
But what do you care?
You're gonna go in the end

Gate open to Heaven
Is ready and waiting
Or straight down to Hell
Can go there as well

I'll suffer my craving
My soul's not worth saving
So why don't you go?
Just leave well alone

Wherever anyone seems to treat me like a freak
It makes me see I'm only one
Who feels that I know what is real
Sometimes it feels like a game of deadly hide and seek
And when you're reading this then I will be gone
Maybe then you will see

"The Edge of Darkness Lyrics[Intro]
I've looked into the heart of darkness
Where the blood-red journey ends
When you've faced the heart of darkness
Even your soul begins to bend

For a week, I have been waiting
Still, I am only in Saigon
The walls move in a little closer
I feel the jungle call me on

[Verse 1]
Every minute, I get weaker
While, in the jungle, they grow strong
What I wanted was a mission
And for my sins, they gave me one
They brought it up just like room service
'Cause everyone gets what they want
And when that mission was all over
I'd never want another one

Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I know, Captain, that you've done this work before
We've got a problem, you can help us all, I'm sure
The colonel's gone rogue and his methods are unsound
You'll take a PBR upriver, track him down

[Verse 3]
There's a conflict in every human heart
And the temptation is to take it all too far
In this war, things get so confused
But there are some things which cannot be excused

He's acting like a God—an insane lunatic
Your mission—terminate with extreme prejudice
The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow
Here is the file and it's all you need to know

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
[Instrumental Break: 4:20-5:16]

[Bridge]
Here I am, the knife in my hand
And now I understand why the genius must die

Now I stand alone in the darkness
With his blood upon my hands
Where sat the warrior, the poet
Now lie the fragments of a man

[Outro]
I've looked into the heart of darkness
Where the blood-red journey ends
When you've faced the heart of darkness
Even your soul begins to bend

I've looked into the heart of darkness1Embed"
"Out of the Shadows Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hold a halo around the world
Golden is the day
Princes of the universe
Your burden is the way
So, there is no better time
Who will be born today?
A gypsy child at daybreak
A king for a day

[Chorus]
Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Out there is beauty, and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again
[Verse 2]
Dust 'n' dreams in fading daylight
Flicker on the walls
Nothing new, your life's adrift
What purpose to it all?
Eyes are closed and death is calling
Reaching out its hand
Call upon the starlight to surround you

[Chorus]
Out of the shadow and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Out there is beauty, and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

Out there is beauty, and surely there is pain

Out there is beauty, and surely there is pain

[Verse 1]
When it all comes down the line
And the lights, they turn to greed
And you race off with your tyres screaming
Rolling thunder
And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got one last bullet
One way ticket out of here

[Chorus]
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
[Verse 2]
In the cities, in the streets
There's a tension you can feel
The breaking strain is fast approaching
Guns and riots
The politicians gamble
And lie to save their skins
And the press get fed their scapegoats

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell you
Your children have more brains
Than your drug infested remains

And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again

The convoy lights are dead ahead
The merchantmen lay in their bed
The thump of diesels hammer down
In the oily sea, the killing ground
Knuckles white, eyes alight
He slams the hatch on the deadly night
A cunning fox in the chicken's lair
A hound of Hell and the Devil don't care

Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below
Running silent, running deep
Sink into your final sleep

Chill the hearts of fighting men
In open ocean wondering when
The lethal silver fish will fly
This boat will shiver, men will die
A cast of millions, a part to play
Killer, victim, fool for the day?
Obeying an order, men have to die
Us or them, a well-rehearsed lie

The tar black smell of burning oil

Stern tubes ready, aim and fire
They can pin some medal on your chest
Ah, in two more weeks, dead like the rest

"Women in Uniform LyricsBeehive hairdo forty-five on the hip
Patrolwoman Saunders don't you give her no lip
Took me to the station for a breath test
Then back to her bedroom for some house-arrest

[Chorus]
Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but oh they feel so warm

Coming back to London on a 747
Stewardess made me feel like I'm in heaven
Looking up the aisle to see what I could see
She leaned over said
Give it to me

White apron, brown leather shoes
The nurse at the clinic left my heart all bruised
Gave me a massage, sprained my right
Now she takes my temperature every night

Commando raid on the Lebanese border
Sergeant Anita, she gives the order
Khaki jacket and a love gun
Baby, I surrender, let's have some fun

"Age of Innocence Lyrics[Intro]
I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart
I can't be sympathising with a new lost cause
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all

[Verse 1]
And all the politicians and their hollow promises
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it
The working man pays everything for their mistakes
And with his life too if there was to be a war

[Chorus]
So we only get one chance
Can we take it?
And we only get one life
Can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have?
Don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream
[Verse 2]
A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday
The victims' minds are scarred for life most everyday
Assailants know just how much further they can go
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low

So we only get one chance
Can we take it?
And we only get one life
Can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have?
Don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream

[Bridge]
You can't protect yourselves, even in your own home
For fear of vigilante cries the victims wipe their eyes
So now the criminals, they laugh right in our face
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace

[Verse 3]
Despondent public worries where it all will end
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend
We cannot warn each other of evil in our midst
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just

So we only get one chance
Can we take it?
And we only get one life
Can't exchange it

"The Educated Fool Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm an educated fool
So I don't know what is I'm supposed to do
About this awkward situation
That's been forced down right upon me

As I'm walking down into
On my own into the valley of life
Got a lifetime of experience
I've got so much to give

[Verse 2]
Open the page on chapter one
Could this just be that life's just begun
Forever within your darker thoughts
Reflecting on everything you've been taught
[Verse 3]
Never felt this way before
Seems that somebody's just opened
The door to the book of life
Or is it death?
Is there ever any way out?

Someone's looking down on me
To the very inner core of my soul
They won't tell me what they see
But I really want to know

[Chorus 1]
I want to live my life on my own
I want to lift the unturned stone
I want to walk right into the fire
I want to live out all my desires

I want to go and see the fire burn
I want to see and feel my world turn
I want to know what more there's to learn
I want to pass the point of no return

[Verse 4]
Do you really want to be
Just another one statistic
Or feel that you really should aspire?
That you really do deserve more?
Do you ever really feel
That you have so much potential inside?
What you really have to give
Could be realised much more

I want to live my life on my own
I want to lift the unturned stone
I want to walk right into the fire
I want to live out all my desires

I want to know what more there's to learn

"2 A.M. Lyrics[Verse 1]
I get in from work at 2:00 AM
And sit down with a beer
Turn on late-night TV
And then I wonder why I am here
It's meaningless and trivial
And it washes over me
And once again, I wonder:
""Is this all there is for me?""

[Chorus]
Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own
[Verse 2]
Life seems so pathetic
I wish I could leave it all behind
This canvas chair, this bed
These walls that fall in on my mind
Hold on for something better
That just drags you through the dirt
Do you just let go or carry on
And try to take the hurt?

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again

But when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all
Because, you see, I can't take no shape or form

I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry
I'll never know the reason why I had to go
Oh, oh, I'm crying
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me
Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?
Ah can't you see me?

I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me
I feel tempted to bring her over to see just what it's
Like to be hanging on the other side
I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died
I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone
Because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone

Now I'm here, can you see me?
'Cause I'm out on my own
When the room goes cold
Tell me you can feel me, 'cause I'm here

Here I am, can you see me?
Passing through, on my way
To a place I'd been to
Only in my dreams before

In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
'Cause you can count your real true friends on one hand
Through life
There are those that deceive you
There are those that'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would die for you?
Thought not

[Verse 2]
Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
So they say

In a world of confusion
People never say what they mean
If you want a straight answer
Go look for one, right now

[Chorus 2]
In a rooms full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall?
Do you sometimes feel like you're on the outside
Looking in?

You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power if you want to

If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way

Are we here for a reason?
I'd like to know just what you think
It would be nice to know what happened
When we die, wouldn't it?

[Chorus 3]
There are some who're wise
There are some who are born naïve
I believe that there are some
That must have lived before, don't you?

As for me, well, I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But I hope that my life's not
An open and shut case

[Verse 4]
Extra sensory perception
Life after death, telepathy
Can the soul live on
And travel through space and time?
You know I feel so elated
'Cause I'm about to find it out
And when I know all the answers
Maybe then I'll come back
To fill you in

[Chorus 4]
You, don't be alarmed now
If I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around
It's me

And don't disbelieve it
No matter what your friends might say
We'll meet up again some place some way

On a cold October morning
As frost lay on the ground
Waiting to make my move
I made no sound
Waiting for the mist
To cover all around
I carefully picked my time
Then took the wall

I'm sick and tired of running
The hunger and the pain
A stop to look about
Then off again
Being at the wrong place
And at the wrong time
Suspected of a hit
That was my crime

Being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive
But I've got to clear my name

Being hunted down like game

Forever looking back
I'll always be a target for attack
Ever moving  onwards
Always on the run

A silent prayer to God to help you on your way
I've been depressed so long
It's hard to remember when I was happy
I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more
But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way
The hardest part is to get on with your life

You're searching in the dark
Clutching at straws to find a way
You take the Tarot cards and throw them to the wind
You question your beliefs, your inner thoughts
Your whole existence
And if there is a God, then answer if you will
And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place
Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace

If you could live your life again
Would you change a thing or leave it all the same?
If you had the chance again
Would you change a thing at all?
When you look back at your past
Can you say that you are proud of what you've done?
Are there times when you believe
That the right you thought was wrong?

"Gates of Tomorrow Lyrics[Verse 1]
Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights

[Verse 2]
To the women and children, the souls of the dead
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek

[Pre-Chorus]
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a God to save you
If you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman for this if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on
[Chorus 1]
Trapped in a web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, no mercy is shed
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, slaves to the dead
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow

Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame

Trapped in a web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, slaves to the dead

Well you'd better just think again
You'd better watch you step now, woman

"Look for the Truth Lyrics[Intro]
All my dark dreams drift like smoke in the breeze
The fear grips me as I fall towards my sleep
Here comes the nightmare that never ends
Here is the dream that makes monsters of men

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
In the house of my soul
In rooms of ugliness and cold
Memories locked away
All the doubts and fears I never faced

Now they come again
I am falling down to meet with them
Fears within us all
Mine awake and they stand up tall
[Chorus]
Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I pray my sleep will break
Maybe this time, I won't wake
Weakness I hide so well
This dagger in my mind will tell

It's my final stand
I make a fist out of each hand
To shadows of the past
Take a breath and I scream, ""Attack""

[Chorus]
Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through
Here is the truth
Deepest cut of all from you

"Lightning Strikes Twice LyricsI feel the breeze on my face in expectance
Not very long before the storm reaches here
Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again
Feel something strong as the power draws near

Is it the rolling of thunder that scares you?
Is it the crashing of clouds that hold fear?
But all I know as I sit in a corner alone
It takes me back to my childhood again

And as I wait and I look for an answer
To all the things going round in my head
I ask myself, could it be a disaster and when
It's maybe threatening to happen again?

As the ominous light draws near
There's a lone dog howls in the park
All the people hurry inside
As a lightning flash lights dark
The storm is nearly here
Only God will know

You're sitting alone, you watch
As the wind's blowing treetops
And the swaying rusting of leaves
Plenty of time to perceive
As you wait for rain to fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Only God knows
The whole sky glows

[Chorus]
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice

"Blood on the World’s Hands Lyrics[Bass Solo]

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, it makes me wonder
Sometimes, it makes me question
Sometimes, it makes me saddened
Always, it makes me angry...
But when you can see it happening
The madness that's all around you
Nobody seems to worry
The world seems so powerless to act...

[Bridge 1]
It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
Each day, a new toll
[Verse 2]
Another assassination
The same day, a new creation
But what are they coming into?
Security of a world that brings...
One day, another killing
Somewhere, there's someone starving
Another, a savage raping
Meanwhile, there's someone laughing at us

[Bridge 2]
It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
Each day, it goes on

[Chorus]
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands

Blood on the world's hands
[Verse 3]
Brutality and aggression
Tomorrow, another lesson
Expecting another air raid
Praying for a ceasefire...
They say things are getting better
No need to be complacent
There's chaos across the border
And one day, it could be happening to us

[Outro]
It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
It's our epitaph
It's out of control
Someone should know
Blood on the world's hands
Someone should...Embed"

Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the light goes down

Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the night comes down

Feel someone's watching you
You've got to get away
Is it the first time you've ever felt this scared?
Feel the adrenaline pump
Your heart begins to race
Begin to run now
The sweat runs down your face

You'd better hide yourself
He's getting close now
You'd better improvise

Just hope you never reach
The point of no return
Could be the last time
You see the light of day

Now the contract's out
They've put the word about

It's the thrill of the chase

Study the things you do
And the pattern of your ways
I watch the way you walk
I hear your telephone talk
I want to understand the way you think

My telescope looks out into the stars tonight
A little speck of light seems twice the size tonight
The calculations are so fine
Can it be growing all the time?

For the hundredth time I check the declination
Now the fear starts to grow
Even my computer shows
There are no errors in the calculations

And I mean she was big, she was fucking huge!
Enormous!
You could have sailed the Hindenburg through her legs and never even have landing permission!

"Cross-Eyed Mary Lyrics[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Who would be a poor man a beggarman, a thief
If he had a rich man in his hand
And who would steal the candy from a laughing baby's mouth
If he could take it from the money man

[Chorus 1]
Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again
She signs no contract but she always plays it clean
She dines in Hampstead village on expense accounted gruel
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school

[Verse 2]
Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys
Would rather make it with a letching gray
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung
Who watches through the railings as they play
[Chorus 2]
Cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along
A poor man's rich girl and she'll do it for a song
A rich man's stealer but her favour's good and strong
She's the Robin Hood of Highgate let the poor man get along

[Guitar solo: Adrian Smith]

[Verse 3]
Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys
Would rather make it with a letching gray
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung
Who watches through the railings as they play

Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again
She signs no contract but she always plays it clean
She dines in Hampstead village on expense accounted gruel
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school

"King of Twilight Lyrics[Spoken: Nicko McBrain]
Are you ready? Have I missed anybody here?
One, two, one, two, three, four!

[Instrumental intro]

I've been trying, trying so hard
I've been crying, crying in the dark
Don't forsake me, the time of mine is near
Don't ever break me and the world that brought me here

Sick and lonely, waiting for the dawn
Sick and lonely, wondering what to do
Can you hear me, when I say to you
You give me your hand, I'll give mine to you
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

When the king of twilight shows me
I will take ten steps to see
Forty leaves I pay for freedom
For a chance to be free
For a chance to be free

Ah-ah-ah-ah

When the king of twilight calls you
Take a step and you will see
We all need a quick solution
For a chance to be free
For a chance to be free

Once used by a man from Gallilea

Doesn't care if lives or if he dies

[Bridge]
""Ignorance is bliss,"" is that the reason
We cannot read another's mind?
If we knew what thoughts were dancing
Through each other's heads
Would we all be driven mad?
Would we all be dead?
[Pre-Chorus]
By your deeds, you will be known
Time will tell, truth will show
As we exhale every breath
We all get closer to our death

"I’m a Mover LyricsI was born by the river, just like this river
I've been moving ever since
Ain't got nobody to call my own
You know I've been moving since the day I was born
Life is a game just made for fun
You know I don't love nobody, I don't love no one

Yes, I'm a mover, baby

Following the footsteps; One fine day
When I asked the wise man which was the way
He said: ""Follow your heart and look for yourself
And come back and tell me what you have learned""

Yes, I'm a mover, baby
Went back and told him, I found me a wife
Eleven children and a real good life
Told him of love and there's a happy home
But I need to return to that long winding road

Yes, I'm a mover, baby
Gotta move on down
Mmmmove onEmbed"

"Age of Innocence... How Old? LyricsOne, two, three, four...
Hahaha!
Oh! They even got the music to go with it, that's lovely!

I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more
Ha ha, oh yeah, ah
I can't remember whats-er-name the name my anger fills me 'art
I can't be sympathising with a new fart
Hahaha! Oh... Ohhh...

I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more
I can't prevent the whatever, My anger fills me heart
I can't be sympathising with a new lost cause
I feel I've lost me patience with the world and all
Oh, and the world and...
So we can only get one chance, can we take it
And we only get one life, can't exchange it
Can we hold onto what we have, don't replace it
Oh the age of innocence is fading like a dream, oh yeah!
I've lost me place; I've no idea where I'm going again!
Oh yes!
...Like an old dream!

You can't protect yourselves even in your own home
For fear of vigilante cries the victims wipe their eyes
So now the criminals they laugh right in our face; Ha ha ha ha!
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace -- yeah!
Oh, a disgrace what I say! WOO-HOO!

So we can only get one chance, can we take it
And we only get one life, can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have, don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like a dreamahh dreamahh
Dadadada Lost me place again!
Lalalalala Oh dear!
Oh the age of innocence, what do you say about that then?
Hang on a minute! Guitar solo coming! (sings guitar solo)
C'mon Davey son, give me some!
Oh, you know don't you, yes!
Oh, that's number two, isn't it?
Age of innocence, oh th age of innocence
When Davey plays that guitar, there's no innocence there!

Oh no, that's the bridge... Oh what comes after that?
Oh, it's another verse, maybe not! Oh dear!

Dee dee nuzzing!
Supposed to be singing here!
...For fear of vigilante crimes the victims wipe their eyes
So now the criminal, they laugh right in our face!

Oh yeah!
I'm supposed to know this tune!
Er, that's what they told me last night anyway!
You didn't do too bad Nicko! Not bad!
Pretty good playing here and there
There's no stopping the old bugger!
Not bad for an old one... How old!?
What about that sleeping bag that's next to Davey's name?
I wonder what that means...
You boys and girls don't really know what's going on, do you?
Well, that makes two of us!
Anyway, ah! I think we're at the end of the tune... Possible!
Dee dee wa wa dee dee dee dee dada dah
...Oh, this is a nice guitar part now!

"Pass the Jam LyricsI don't care
They're crazy
Said pass the jam, would you
Awfully kind of you
Now wouldn't it be a little bit nice to sing with this

Gazing at the open door
Just what lays behind
Thinking what I'm looking for
Say what's on my mind

Sinking ever deeper
In the words of guilt of shame
And now I can redeem myself
I just don't care
The words I'm singing they're just right
That's better for my brain
If I try to make much sense
You know I'll go insane

I just don't care
I just don't care

Stay and have some jam with tea
But Brutus wasn't kind
Wasn't strawberries that were red
He wasn't cutting bread

You pass the jam
And so he slammed the tea
? here to me
Was in the conservatory

Yeah, alright
Yes, but still over there
Sinking ever deeper
In the words of guilt and shame
I can redeem myself
I just don't care

Staring at the silver spoon
Take it from your mouth
Take it from the chapter
Turn and face the south
Now face the north
And the east
And the west
And the ?serpent song?

Still burning on in the night
Where's the sun at midnight
Say it's gone

Where's the moon at dawn
It carries on and on
It never ends

To the land of nevermore
Where time began
Where the man still stands

And the ? 'x' ? at the end
Never know that I sang
You'll all know it's the right place
In time, well it is

The words I'm singing
That's just right
They're better for my brain
If I try to make much sense
You know I'll go insaneEmbed"

"Aces High [Live After Death] Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble, we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks
There's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late

[Chorus 1]
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high
[Guitar Solo: Dave Murray]
[Guitar Solo: Adrian Smith]

[Verse 2]
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again
Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109s out of the sun
Ascending and turning our Spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

[Chorus 2]

"Two Minutes To Midnight LyricsKill for gain or shoot to maim
But we don’t need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here’s my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death

The killer’s breed or the demon’s seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom’s stain
Don’t you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
The blind men shout let the crеatures out
We’ll show the unbеlievers
The Napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast, yeah
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat
And lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine
And feed it with our babies

The killer’s breed or the demon’s seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom’s stain
Don’t you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb

The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain
To put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all
Dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions
To make a better kind of gun
The killer’s breed or the demon’s seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom’s stain
Don’t you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb

"Rime of the Ancient Mariner [Live After Death] LyricsHear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea

And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings

And the ship sails on, back to the north
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on
The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime

Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse, a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung

And the curse goes on and on and on and on and on at sea
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me

""Day after day, day after day
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink""

""There,"" calls the mariner, ""There comes a ship o’er the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?""

See... onward she comes
Onward she nears, out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but there's two
Death and she life in death
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now
Then... crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She... she, life in death
She lets him live, her chosen one

""One after one by the star dogged moon
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump
They dropped down one by one.""

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he

And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too
Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain

[Guitar Solo]

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes

And revenge still is sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit
Penance of life will fall onto him

And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins

The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on and on and onEmbed"
"Hallowed Be Thy Name [Live After Death] Lyrics[Intro]
I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah

[Verse 1]
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?
[Verse 2]
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak

Tears fall but why am I crying?
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?

[Verse 3]
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell ""God be with you""
If there's a God why has He let me go?

As I walk my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

[Verse 4]
Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth

When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion

Take not thy thunder from us
Take away our pride

The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the Nile are opening, you'll see

She came to me with a serpent's kiss
As the eye of the sun rose on her lips
Moonlight catches silver tears that I cry
So we lay in a black embrace
And the seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched and I waited for the dawn, oh

The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the Nile are opening, you'll see

"The Clansman [Rock in Rio] LyricsSpoken: A song for everybody out there, song based in medieval Scotland, called The Clansman. The song is about freedom, which should be something familiar to you all, but which sometimes is not

Wake alone in the hills
With the wind in your face
It feels good to be proud
And be free and a race
That is part of a clan
And to live on highlands
And the air that you breathe
So pure and so clean

When alone on the hills
With the wind in your hair
With a longing to feel
Just to be free

In the need to be free

And without asking why
Can't you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land
That belongs to the clans

Not alone with a dream
Just a want to be free
With a need to belong

They would all be ashamed

Has been written in chains

And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what I want

And I swear to defend
And we'll fight to the end
And I swear that I'll never
Be taken alive
And I know that we'll stand
And we'll fight for our land
And I swear that my bairns
Will be born free

"Phantom of the Opera [Live After Death] Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding
And hiding behind that false mask
You know, and I know that you ain't got long now to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past

[Verse 2]
You're standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Now, I know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call

[Bridge]
Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away, yeah
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way, yeah
[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I'm running and hiding in my dreams, you're always there
You're the Phantom of the Opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul, it just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair

[Outro]
Torture me back at your lairEmbed"
"Fear of the Dark [Live Chapter] Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

[Verse 2]
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it’s dark

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
[Short Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you’re searching for the light?

[Verse 4]
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

[Verse 5]
Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there?

[Verse 6]
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there’s someone there
[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something’s always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark

[Verse 7]
Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind

[Verse 8]
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind
[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something’s always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

[Short Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
When I’m walking a dark road
I am a man who walks aloneEmbed"
"Powerslave [Life After Death] Lyrics[Verse 1]
Into the Abyss I'll fall, the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night, watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris, risen again

[Chorus]
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death
[Verse 2]
When I was living this lie, fear was my game
People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and
Red wine for the one to succeed me
For He is a man and a God
And He will die too

[Chorus]
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death

[Instrumental break/bridge]

[Verse 3]
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man, god preserved -
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell
I'll strike from the grave
[Chorus]
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death

Slave to the Power of Death...

"The Number of the Beast [Live After Death] Lyrics[Spoken intro: Barry Clayton]
Woe to you, o'er Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty six

[Verse 1: Bruce Dickinson]
I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams, were they
Reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cause in my dreams, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
YEAH!

[Verse 2]
The night was black, was no use holding back
Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of hell?

[Chorus 1]
666 the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

[Verse 3]
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done

[Chorus 2]
666 the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

[Guitar solo: Dave Murray]
[Guitar solo: Adrian Smith]

[Verse 4]
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes
[Chorus 3]
666 the number of the beast
666 the one for you and me

[Verse 5]
I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its courseEmbed"

"The Trooper [Live After Death] Lyrics[Verse 1]
You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day
[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

"She’s Gone Lyrics========================
Iron Maiden - She's Gone
========================

(Note: Performed at the Marquee club 19. 12. 1985)
(Note: Original by Black Sabbath, on album Technical Ecstasy)

I've been gone a long long time, waiting for you
I din't want to see you go
And now it's hurting so much, what can I do?
I wanted you to be my wife
The days are passing slowly, since you've gone
Your memories are all I have
I sit here waiting but you'll never show
Without you I can't carry on
You said you'd always love me, all of my life
And then you said your last goodbye
Why the sudden change, why all the lies
I should have seen it in your eyes
The endless hours of heartache, waiting for you
My summer love has turned to rain
The silent emptiness of one sided love
My life means nothing now you're gone...Embed"

Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do?
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way

Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath

Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come

The ferryman wants his money, you ain't gonna give it back
He can push his own boat as you set off up the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light

Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence

I would bleed for her, If I could only see her now

The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you, some day I may return

As the ground warms to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still

His eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gaze

Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
""In the name of God, my father, I fly""

[Pre-Chorus]
His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes, to ashes his grave

Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun

"Ghost of the Navigator [Rock in Rio] Lyrics[Verse 1]
I have sailed to many lands
Now I make my final journey
On the bow I stand
West is where I go
Through the night I plough
Still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong
I will not be led astray

[Hook 1]
Mysteries of time, clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
[Chorus]
Take my heart and set it free
Carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel

[Verse 2]
I steer between the crashing rocks
The sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm
Blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now
As sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way

[Hook 1]
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
[Chorus]
Take my heart and set it free
Carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

[Chorus]
Take my heart and set it free
Carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so

"2 Minutes To Midnight [Rock in Rio] Lyrics[Verse 1]
Kill for gain, or shoot to maim
But we don't need a reason
The golden goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?
[Chorus]
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb

[Verse 2]
The blind men shout ""Let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers""
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast ... yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies

[Pre-Chorus]
The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?

The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb

[Verse 3]
The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun

[Pre-Chorus]
The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?

To kill the unborn in the womb

If you're feeling down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go
22 Acacia Avenue
Meet a lady that I know
So if you’re looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybody's got their vice

[Verse 2]
If you’re waiting for a long time
For the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
And you might even get it free
So any time you're down the East End
Don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can know
[Pre-Chorus]
Charlotte can't you get out from all this madness?
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting disease
Some day when you're reach the age of forty
I bet you’ll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won’t have any beautiful wares to show, any more

[Chorus]
22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it’s warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
Don't you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?
Sometimes when your strolling down the avenue
The way you walk it makes men think of having you
When you’re walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you

[Chorus]
22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight
[Bridge]
Beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want?

[Outro]
You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning?
Your life's good don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags, you're coming with meEmbed"
"Hallowed Be Thy Name [Rock in Rio] Lyrics[Intro]
I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah

[Verse 1]
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?
[Verse 2]
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak

Tears fall but why am I crying?
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?

[Verse 3]
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell ""God be with you""
If there's a God why has He let me go?

As I walk my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

[Verse 4]
Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth

When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion

"Sign of the Cross [Rock in Rio] Lyrics[Intro]

Eleven saintly shrouded men
Silhouettes stand against the sky
One in front with a cross held high
Come to wash my sins away

[Verse 1]
Standing alone in the wind and rain
Feeling the fear that is growing
Sensing the change in the tide again
Brought by the storm that is brewing

[Verse 2]
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
Some of the doubt in the things you believe
Now that your faith will be put to the test
Nothing to do but await what is coming
[Verse 3]
Why is then God still protecting me
Even when I don't deserve it?
Though I am blessed with an inner strength
Some, they would call it a penance

[Verse 4]
Why am I meant to face this alone?
Asking the question time and again
Praying to God won't keep me alive
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise

[Verse 5]
They'll be saying their prayers when the moment comes
There'll be penance to pay when it's judgement day
And the guilty'll bleed when that moment comes
They'll be coming to claim, take your soul away

[Chorus]
The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross

They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame
They'll be bringing us all immortality
Holding comunion so the world be blessed
My creator, my God, lay my soul to rest

A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross

Chose the lust of the earth below

"If Eternity Should Fail [Live Chapter] Lyrics[Intro: Bruce Dickinson]
Here is the soul of a man
Here in this place for the taking
Clothed in white, stand in the light
Here is the soul of a man

Time to speak with the shaman again
Conjure the jester again
Black dog in the ruins is howling my name
So here is the soul of a man

[Verse 1: Bruce Dickinson]
When the world was virgin before the coming of men
Just a solar witness, the beginning of the end
From a world of magma to a cold rock face
The ascent of madness and a human race
We are strange believers all of us
There are stranger truths immortal lust
We rise from slumber he calls our name
Recalls our number abide with pain

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail
Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

[Verse 2: Bruce Dickinson]
To god’s illusion which I recall
Was our delusion before the fall
The angels come and the angels go
But the lord of light shining below

Eternal blackness beyond the stars
We think our wisdom will get that far
At the master’s table, the table’s bare
No land of plenty, devastation, despair

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world

Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Good day, my name is Necropolis
I am formed of the dead

"Blood Brothers [Rock in Rio] Lyrics[Verse 1]
And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me

[Verse 2]
Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again

[Chorus]
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
[Verse 3]
And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned?
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnt

[Chorus]
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

[Verse 4]
There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand

[Chorus]
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes

"The Book of Souls [Live Chapter] Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sacrifices buried with kings
Accompany them on a journey with no end
To an afterlife that’s rich with fruit of all the gods
And to face the demons
Of their underworld haunts

[Verse 2]
The sentient is sent to seek out all the truth
A flight to earth that is a given from his birth
To rise from ashes of the dead
Out of the fire is sent to fulfill man’s desire

[Pre-Chorus]
By power day and night and death he ruled them
The sky and earth and the fires too
Two headed reptile, symbol of his reign
Universes of the underworld
A life that’s full of all the wealth and riches
Can never last for an eternity
After living in a golden paradise, the ultimate sacrifice
[Chorus]
Prophecy of sky gods, the sun and moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon
Falling of ages, forest of kings
The search for the truth, the book of souls

[Verse 3]
The rulers of planets and stars
The power of the kings of traders and the wars
Planetary cycles and the phases of the moon
Is in the document a kingdom they will learn

[Pre-Chorus]
They were praying to the gods of nature
And were living in the cities of stone
Towers reaching upward to the heavens
Sacred wonders for the world unknown
Make their lives be a mystery no more
Records kept and the passing of laws
Sacred gods to the book of lies
When a civilization dies

[Chorus]
Prophecy of sky gods, the sun and moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon
Falling of ages, forest of kings
The lost book of souls, destruction begins
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Ascending the throne wearing feathers and shells
He brought back their lives from the void
Alien invasion brings nothing but death
Mass exodus and plant life destroyed

[Verse 5]
Domain of the Earth to the journey of truth
The underworld caves, Mayan slaves
Defeat of the dark Lords, the ultimate proof
In the place where the ancestors rule

Dying swans, twisted wings
Beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life
In this garden of fear

All is lost, sold your soul

You've sensed that something's watching you

"The Number of the Beast [Rock in Rio] Lyrics[Spoken intro: Barry Clayton]
Woe to you, o'er Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty six

[Verse 1: Bruce Dickinson]
I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams, were they
Reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cause in my dreams, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
YEAH!

[Verse 2]
The night was black, was no use holding back
Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of hell?

[Chorus 1]
666 the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

[Verse 3]
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done

[Chorus 2]
666 the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

[Guitar solo: Dave Murray]

This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes
[Chorus 3]
666 the number of the beast
666 the one for you and me

And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn

We won't live to fight another day

When a Russian gets me in his sights

My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

Got to keep myself from drifting

Take the wrong way out running out of breath
Meet my match in the afterlife
Suppress the demons that plague the night
A tortured mind is a safe place to go
But the truth lurks down in the dark below
Step inside my inquisitive mind
Are you scared at what you just might find

See myself in the hall of mirrors
A different shape every step I take
A different mind every step of the line
But in the end they are all mine
Laughing sorrow inside your head
Can’t get out just a feeling of dread
I know this burden's a heavy load
A dark mistake never ending road
The black jack king and the red queen clash
The artful dodger he counts his stash
The joker’s wild like an impish child
While madame fortune she waits inside
The good luck charm is overkill
The tired old soldier says fire at will
Planes overhead go search destroy
The ones below human decoy

I need somebody to save me

Meanwhile we play the waiting game
The clock is struck the horse is lame
And when we think that this is done
Chance your luck a four leafed one
You hedge your bets the battle lost
To wait in vain and count the cost
The thin edged line
Between good and bad
And cast the luck be happy sad

I need somebody to save me

The red and the black
People don’t want the truth
Look in their eyes and you send them away
The red and the black
Fate and hypocrisy
Burden’s a heavy load there is no doubt
The red and the black
All out of luck again
How many chances can anyone have
The red and the black
Treachery out to win
There in the wrong place and at the wrong time
I need somebody to save meEmbed"

And the path to follow to the great unknown
Where the dark has fallen and the seed is sown

In the selfish hearts of some
The nightmare’s coming
With the spilling blood of others
Now wringing through
Now the cup is spilling over
Wake to news of death
And the prophecy of sages
Destiny is met
To the depths of human mind
The cry is burning
With the mentor’s anger
Of the lesson ringing true
And for those who live by and are dying by the sword
They will take their ideals with them
Justify their end
[Bridge]
Where the fools are lying and the meek are crying
Where the wolves are preying
On the weak alone
Where the sons are dying
Hear their mothers crying
And the distant sound of fire
Begins again

[Chorus]
Never ending the desires of men
It’ll never be the same or calm again
In a time of changing hearts
And great unknown
It’ll be the damnation and end of us all

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Where the fools are lying and the meek are crying
Where the wolves are preying
On the weak alone
Where the sons are dying
Hear their mothers crying
And the distant sound of fire
Begins again
[Chorus]
Never ending the desires of men
It’ll never be the same or calm again
In a time of changing hearts
And great unknown
It’ll be the damnation and end of us all

"Children of the Damned [Live Chapter] Lyrics[Verse 1]
He's walking like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home

[Chorus]
Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned

[Verse 2]
He's walking like a dead man
If he had lived he would've crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought; ""Oblivion? Well, it beckons us all""
[Chorus]
Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned

[Bridge]
Now it's burning his hands, he's turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face, screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on the ground, what did we learn?

Ooooooooo-o-o-o-o-ooh
Ooooooooo-o-o-o-o-ooh

[Outro]
You're children of the Damned
Your back's against the wall
You turn into the light
You're burning in the night
You're children of the Damned
Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
You'll burn again tonight
Children of the DamnedEmbed"
"Wrathchild [Live Chapter] Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was born into a scene of angriness and greed
And dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen, my dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be
And now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around

[Chorus]
'Cos I'm a wrathchild
Well, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah
[Guitar Solo]

Oh... yeah!

[Verse 2]
Say it doesn't matter, ain't nothin' gonna alter
The course of my destination
I know I've got to find some serious piece of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazy
But now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around

[Chorus]
'Cos I'm a wrathchild
Well, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah

Yeah!Embed"
"Iron Maiden [Live Chapter] Lyrics[Verse 1]
Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare

"Man on the Edge (Live) LyricsSpoken: Alright, it's a story about a briefcase, a lunch, and a Man on the Edge

[Verse 1]
The freeway is jammed
And it's backed up for miles
The car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be
What we deserve we just don't get you see
A briefcase, a lunch and a man on the edge
Each step gets closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven? Are they looking down?
Cause nothing is fair just you look around

[Chorus]
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
[Verse 2]
He's sick of waiting of lying like this
There's a hole in thе sky for the angels to kiss
Branded a lеper because you don't fit
In the land of the free
You just live by your wits
Once he built missiles a nations defence
Now he can't even give birthday presents
Across the city he leaves in his wake
A glimpse of the future a cannibal state

[Chorus]
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
The freeway is jammed
And it's backed up for miles
The car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be
What we deserve we just don't get you see
A briefcase, a lunch and a man on the edge
Each step gets closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven? Are they looking down?
Cause nothing is fair just you look around
[Chorus]
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down

"Death or Glory [Live Chapter] LyricsI see the enemy, I know he can’t see me
Combat red in tooth and claw
Ready now for one more score
Took a bullet in my brain
Inside I’m the king of pain
Outside you will fear my name
I ride a blood red triplane

[Bridge]
Turn like the devil, shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey out of hell where I belong

[Chorus]
Death or glory, it’s all the same
Death or glory, the price of fame
Death or glory, I’m in the game of
Death or glory, a one way train
I watch you spiral down
Dead before you hit the ground
Bullet got you in the back
Deflection shooting beam attack
I shoot the gunner first
I kill to quench my thirst
I hunt the weakest prey
Live to fly another day

[Bridge]
Turn like the devil, shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey out of hell where I belong

[Chorus]
Death or glory, it’s all the same
Death or glory, the price of fame
Death or glory, I’m in the game of
Death or glory, a one way train

[Bridge]
Turn like the devil, shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey out of hell where I belong

Death or glory, it’s all the same
