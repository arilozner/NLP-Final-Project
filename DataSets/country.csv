Oh, oh-oh

[Chorus: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more (Kio, Kio)
[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now
[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2: Lil Nas X]
Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Chorus: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road

"All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) [From the Vault] Lyrics[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""
[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it198Embed"
"Lover Lyrics[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my

"​betty Lyrics[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you
[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you89Embed"

"Love Story Lyrics[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Breakdown]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said

[Chorus]
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

Oh, oh, oh

"Hurt Lyrics[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way142Embed"

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep it pouring
And I ain't seen the light of day since, well, that's not important, it's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winnin', you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'

It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had eighty beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can

"Burning House Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I had a dream about a burning house
You were stuck inside, I couldn't get you out
I laid beside you and pulled you close
And the two of us went up in smoke
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone

[Chorus]
I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house
[Verse 2]
See you at a party and you look the same
I could take you back but people don't ever change
Wish that we could go back in time
I'd be the one you thought you'd find
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone

[Chorus]
I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

The flames are getting bigger now
In this burning house
I can hold on to you somehow
In this burning house
Oh, and I don't want to wake up
In this burning house

We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, ""That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account""
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out

She says, ""I think he did it, but I just can't prove it""

And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause

Mr. ""I've been waitin' for you all my life""
Mr. ""Every single day until the end, I will be by your side""

But that was when I got to know Mr. ""Change of heart""
Mr. ""Leaves me all alone,"" I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay

Hello, Mr. ""Perfectly fine""
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. ""Always at the right place at the right time,"" baby
Hello, Mr. ""Casually cruel""
Mr. ""Everything revolves around you""
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine""

Mr. ""Never told me why""
Mr. ""Never had to see me cry""
Mr. ""Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy""
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same

'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her

So strategized, all the eyes on you

Oh, he's so smug, Mr. ""Always wins""
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame

Now I'm Miss ""Gonna be alright someday""

"Daddy Lessons Lyrics[Intro]
Yee-haw
Ooh
Texas, Texas (Ooh) Texas

[Verse 1]
Came into this world, daddy's little girl
And Daddy made a soldier out of me (Ooh)
Daddy made me dance and Daddy held my hand (Ooh)
And Daddy liked his whiskey with his tea

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said, ""Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister""
And oh, that's when he gave to me
[Chorus]
With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone, ""Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around""
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Yee, woo
Ooh
Yee-haw (Woo)

[Verse 2]
Daddy made me fight, it wasn't always right
But he said, ""Girl, it's your second amendment"" (Ooh)
He always played it cool, but Daddy was no fool
And right before he died, he said, ""Remember...""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He said, ""Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister""
That's when Daddy looked at me
[Chorus]
With his gun, with his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot (Yee)
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Yee-haw)
'Cause he held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
And he told me when he's gone, ""Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around""
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Woo)

"Oh My Darling Clementine LyricsOh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

In a cavern, in a canyon
Excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner
And his daughter, Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Light she was and like a fairy
And her shoes were number nine
Herring boxes, without topses
Sandals were for Clementine
Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Drove she ducklings to the water
Ev'ry morning just at nine
Hit her foot against a splinter
Fell into the foaming brine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Ruby lips above the water
Blowing bubbles, soft and fine
But, alas, I was no swimmer
So I lost my Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

How I missed her! How I missed her
How I missed my Clementine
But I kissed her little sister
I forgot my Clementine
Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine12Embed"

Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was
Ooh, but you won't like it that way

You know that you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)

When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well

Ooh, I guess I'll never know
Ooh, and you'll go on with the show

And brought me back from bein' too far gone

You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothin' like your love to get me high

The last long day she said goodbye
Well, Lord, I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over; I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues

Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal

But she just wouldn't stay
So now that she is leaving this is all I can say

With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me

You're just a step on the boss man's ladder

Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it

When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, ""She looks like she's been through it""

Once I've lost my novelty?

And I know it's sad but this is what I think about

But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?

And someone else lights up the room? (Ahh)

If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times, they are a-changin'

Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times, they are a-changin'

The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last
For the times, they are a-changin'38Embed"
"My Church Lyrics[Verse 1]
I’ve cussed on a Sunday
I’ve cheated and I’ve lied
I’ve fallen down from grace
A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
Roll the windows down and turn up the dial

[Chorus]
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church
[Verse 2]
When Hank brings the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold, cold heart burnin'
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
Until my sins wash away

[Chorus]
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

And then I go to strike a pose in my full-length mirror
I cross my legs just like a queer
But my libido is strong when a lady is near, yeah
What defines a straight man's straight?
Is it the boxer in the brief or a twelve-ounce steak?
Nah, I'll tell you what a woman loves most
It's a man who can slap but can also stroke

Going in the wind is an eddy of the truth and it's naked

UGH!

I live by a hospital
And every day, I go out walking past its sickly windows
I see people dying there
But my tender age makes it hard to care
The incinerator and a big smokestack
It's a phallic symbol and it makes me laugh (Makes me laugh)
All I need is a heart attack, c'mon
Humble my bones with a cardiac (Humble my bones with a cardiac)

"Holy Ground Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

[Chorus]
And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
[Verse 2]
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

[Chorus]
'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

Never looking down
And right there where we stood

""There must be some way out of here""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth""

""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late""

While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside, in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching

"Whiskey Lullaby Lyrics[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
She put him out
Like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss ]
He put that bottle to his head
And pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, ""I'll love her 'til I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night...

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
She put that bottle to her head
And pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow

He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy

And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid

"The Devil Went Down to Georgia Lyrics[Verse 1]
The Devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said ""Boy, let me tell you what.""
""I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too
And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you.""

[Pre-Chorus]
The boy said, ""My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret, 'cause I'm the best there's ever been.""
[Chorus]
Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

[Verse 2]
The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show.""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:
[Demonic violin piece]

[Verse 3]
When the Devil finished, Johnny said, ""Well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.""

""Fire on the Mountain"" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no
[Non-demonic violin piece]
[Verse 4]
The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
I done told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been.""
And he played:

""Fire on the Mountain"" Run, boys, run!

3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

[Verse 4: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy

The voices so loud, sayin'
""Why did you let her go?""
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had?
[Verse 5: Taylor Swift]
Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave

""Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me""

She's puttin’ her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don’t mean
And you know

[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
I met her down at Aldean's
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around

Oh, there’s two things that you’re gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I’da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave ’em alone)
Leave them Broadway girls alone

They on me, they tryna finesse me
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
I can't run out of money
The trenches love me forever
They treat me like Ed in London
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars

Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)

Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through... again
My mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known
[Verse 2]
Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I should've known

[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known

You should've known
Don't you think I was too young?

"Angels Like You Lyrics[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name, only ""baby""
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right

[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me
[Post-Chorus]
I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la
I'm everything they said I would be

[Verse 2]
I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you
Tonight, mother says you don't look happy
Close your eyes

[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me

I'm everything they said I would be

"Better Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn’t know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
[Verse 2]
I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it’s always on your terms
I’m hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You’re talking down to me like I'll always be around
You push my love away like it's some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I’d run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I hold onto this pride because these days, it's all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can't say that
You can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would’ve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man

First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm

"You All Over Me (Taylor’s Version) [From the Vault] Lyrics[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, with Maren Morris]
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
Well I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, with Maren Morris]
I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

"7 Summers Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah, you used to talk about
Getting even further South
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now
Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house

[Chorus]
But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet
Of a good old boy like me
'Cause I still
Go drinkin', same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way anyway

But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever

That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
""You'll never reach it""

Every move I make feels lost with no direction
My faith is shaken

But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

Too fucked up to get back home

Smoking Spirits on the roof

And how I can always count on you
To be there when the bullets fly
I'd run across the river just to hold you tonight

Well my heart is sweating bullets
From the circles it has raced
Like a little feathered indian
Callin' out the clouds for rain
I'd go runnin' through the thicket
I'd go careless through the thorns
Just to hold her for a minute
Though it'd leave me wanting more

"Country Song Lyrics[Intro]
Boy, oh boy. Any big fans of country music out there?
*Applause*
Yeah! Ooh, some people extending my name, ""Boo"" that's also approval! I- I think- I think country music Get's a bad- Get's a bad rep, you know? Why is it, when Bruce Springsteen sings about a- when Bruce Springsteen sings about a fuckin' turnpike, it is art, and then when someone sings about a horse, it's dumb, inherently? I don't know, I think some of the greatest song writers of all time are country artists: Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, you know? And if you're writing honestly, that is art! And I would never bash that! Um, the problem is, with a lot of modern country music, wha- what is called ""Stadium Country Music""
Sort of Keith Urban Brand of Country music is that it is not honest, it is the exact opposite of honest
*Country music starts playing and Bo speaks in a faux-country accent*
Where instead of people actually telling their stories, you got a bunch of millionaire metrosexuals who've never done a hard days work in their life, but they figured out the words and the phrases they can use to pander to their audience, and they list the same words and phrases off sort of mad libs style in every song, raking in millions of dollars from actual working class people! You know the words, you know the phrases, phrases like--

[Verse 1]
A dirt road, a cold beer
A blue jeans, a red pickup
A rural noun, simple adjective
No shoes, no shirt
No Jews, you didn't hear that
Sort of a mental typo
[Pre-Chorus]
I walk and talk like a field hand
But the boots I'm wearing cost three grand
I write songs about riding tractors
From the comfort of a private jet

[Chorus]
I could sing in Mandarin
You'd still know I'm pandering
Huntin' deer and chasing trout
A Bud Light with the logo facing out
Hear that subtle mandolin
That's textbook panderin'
I own a private ranch that I rarely use
I don't like dirt

[Spoken]
One verse, one chorus in the bag
Now it's time to talk to the ladies
I'm hoping my Southern charm offsets all these rape-y vibes I'm puttin' out

[Verse 2]
Good girl in a straw hat
With her arms out in a corn field
That is a scarecrow
Thought that was a human woman, sorry
A cold night, a cold beer
A cold jeans, strike that last one
I'm wanting you, I hope you're feeling me
Sub-textually
[Pre-Chorus]
We go to bed, you doze off
So I take your country girl clothes off
I put my hands on your body
It feels like hay, it's a fucking scarecrow again

[Chorus]
Like Mike’s Evander-ing
Fuck your ears I'm pandering
I write songs for the people who do
Jobs in the towns that I'd never move to
Legalize gerry-mandering
Tolerate my pandering
You got a beautiful mouth
I got a beautiful (dick)
Y'all dumb motherfuckers want a key change?

Thematically meandering
Emphatically pandering
I got a tight grip on my demo's balls
Say the word ""truck,"" they jizz in their overalls

I'm in the land of pandering
And I'll be upfront
I do what I do 'cause I'm a total fuckin' country boy12Embed"

"Folsom Prison Blues Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

[Verse 2]
When I was just a baby my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

[Verse 3]
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me
[Verse 4]
Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away24Embed"

I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered""
[Verse 2]
I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines, wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid""
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered""

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment?
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you
[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid""
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered34Embed"
"Barrett’s Privateers Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, the year was 1778
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
A letter of marque came from the king
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

[Verse 2]
Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
For twenty brave men all fishermen who
Would make for him the Antelope's crew
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers
[Verse 3]
The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

[Verse 4]
On the King's birthday we put to sea
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
We were 91 days to Montego Bay
Pumping like madmen all the way
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

[Verse 5]
On the 96th day we sailed again
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers
[Verse 6]
Now the Yankee lay low down with gold
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

[Verse 7]
Then at length we stood two cables away
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din
But with one fat ball, the Yank stove us in
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

[Verse 8]
The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
And the Main truck carried off both me legs
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers
[Verse 9]
So here I lay in my 23rd year
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
It's been 6 years since we sailed away
And I just made Halifax yesterday
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier

"Don’t Think Jesus Lyrics[Verse 1]
A boy gets a guitar and starts writing songs
About whiskey and women and getting too stoned
He got all three at the first show he played
Hometown said, ""I don't think Jesus done it that way""
Boy moves to city lives fast and goes hard
Starts chasing the devil through honky-tonk bars
Ignoring the voices in his head that say, ""I don't think Jesus done it this way""

[Chorus]
If I was Him I'd say, ""To hell with you, ain't no helping you”
Find someone else to give Heaven to, I'm telling you
I'd shame me, I'd blame me
I'd make me pay for my mistakes
Oh, but I don't think Jesus does it that way
[Verse 2]
Boy's all alone, got no one to turn to
He figures he'll pray 'cause what else could he do?
He said, ""I wish You would've woke me up an easier way""
But I don't think Jesus does it that way

[Chorus]
If I was Him I'd say, ""To hell with you, ain't no helping you”
Find someone else to give Heaven to, I'm telling you
I'd shame me, I'd blame me
I'd make me pay for my mistakes
But I don't think Jesus does it that way

[Outro]
World likes to rear back and throw a few stones
So boy wants to throw a few stones of his own
But Lord knows I ain't perfect, and it ain't my place
And I don't think Jesus done it that way
Are y'all sure that Jesus done it that way?3Embed"

Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine

Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt

Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)

And not even think about you

Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory, it only hits me this hard

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

"Before He Cheats Lyrics[Verse 1]
Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

[Chorus]
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats
[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know

[Chorus]
Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats

"Rocky Raccoon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, ""I'm gonna get that boy""
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

[Chorus]
And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
[Verse 2]
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, ""Rocky, you met your match""
And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able""

[Chorus]
And now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

"Red Lyrics[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met

Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)

A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

All fadin' out like I always knew they would

He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, ""Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?""
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity

[Pre-Chorus]
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 3 AM, pacing
He says, ""It's not just a phase I'm in""
My voice comes out begging

All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead

[Pre-Chorus]
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 5 AM, wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screaming

[Chorus]
All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

[Bridge]
If I was standing there in your apartment
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
I'd say I love you even at your darkest and
Please don't go
[Chorus]
I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren’t around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be your summer sun forever
At 3 AM, pacing
All this time I didn't know
At 5 AM, wasted
I'd be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go

"Graceland Too Lyrics[Verse 1]
No longer a danger to herself or others
She made up her mind and laced up her shoes
Yelled down the hall, but nobody answered
So she walked outside without an excuse

[Chorus]
She can do anything she wants to
She can do whatever she wants to do
She can go home, but she's not going to

[Verse 2]
So she picks a direction, it's ninety in Memphis
Turns up the music so thoughts don't intrude
Predictably winds up thinking of Elvis
And wonders if he believed songs could come true
[Chorus]
I'm asking for it if they do
Doesn't know what she wants or what she's gonna do
A rebel without a clue

[Bridge]
So we spent what was left of our serotonin
To chew on our cheeks and stare at the moon
Said she knows she lived through it to get to this moment
Ate a sleeve of saltines on my floor and I knew then

[Chorus]
I would do anything you want me to
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, I would do anything
Whatever you want me to do, I will do

[Outro]
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)

"I Wish Grandpas Never Died Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wish girls you loved never gave back diamond rings
I wish every porch had a swing
Wish kids still learned to say ""sir"" and ""ma'am"", how to shake a hand
I wish every state had a Birmingham

I wish everybody knew all the words to Mama Tried
I wish Monday mornin's felt just like Friday nights

And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never run out of cold Bud Light
And I wish high school home teams never lost
And back road drinkin' kids never got caught
And I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honky-tonks didn't have no closin' time
And I wish grandpas never died

I wish Sunday's on a creek bank would never end
Wish I could learn to drive again
Wish the first time, seventeen, she was my everything kiss in a Chevrolet
Could happen every day

I wish Country music still got played on Country radio

I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
You're not looking for anything right now
So, I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl, I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you
But I want to

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind

I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

[Verse 2]
I know it starts with hello
The next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
'Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much
And wanna stay too long
It's the same old song
And dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes
[Chorus]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind

"Highwayman Lyrics[Verse 1: Willie Nelson]
I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of '25
But I am still alive

[Verse 2: Kris Kristofferson]
I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner around the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still
[Verse 3: Waylon Jennings & All]
I was a dam builder
Across a river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder, on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that gray tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around
And around, and around, and around
And around, and around, and around...

[Verse 4: Johnny Cash & All]
I fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again
And again, and again, and again
And again, and again...18Embed"

Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong

Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die

And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it

And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby

Who would have thought forever could be severed by

And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone

Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

[Verse 2]
I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms
[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 3]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

[Verse 4]
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss

I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
