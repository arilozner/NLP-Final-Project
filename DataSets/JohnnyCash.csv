"You Are My Sunshine Lyrics[Verse 1]
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

[Chorus]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I've always loved you and made you happy
And nothing else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams
[Chorus]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

[Spoken Outro]
(Oh, that's how you get through the verse)
*Laughter*
It was a nice short version
Do you wanna- uh, pick it up?
I't's alright (It's good)
(We got a short version)
It might have that other verse on it in another take
Well, I'll tell you what... Let's... uhm...
Well, if I feel like my song's a song... *Laughter*
It don't care... (There you go!)
I don't care if it's short
And I feel like my song's a song
A pleasure! Two minutes... I've recorded songs two minutes
(They were huge hits!)
Have you got, uh, time on that?8Embed"
"Hurt Lyrics[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way142Embed"
"Ring of Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire

"I Walk The Line Lyrics[Verse 1]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 2]
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 3]
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
[Verse 4]
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 1]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line22Embed"
"Folsom Prison Blues Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

[Verse 2]
When I was just a baby my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

[Verse 3]
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me
[Verse 4]
Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away24Embed"
"The Man Comes Around Lyrics[Intro]
And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder
One of the four beasts saying ""Come and see""
And I saw, and behold, a white horse

[Verse 1]
There's a man going 'round taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around

[Verse 2]
The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup?
Or disappear into the potter's ground?
When the man comes around
[Chorus]
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

[Verse 3]
'Til Armageddon, no salaam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise men will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around

[Verse 4]
Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around
[Chorus]
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
In measured hundredweight and penny pound
When the man comes around

[Outro]
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts
And I looked, and behold, a pale horse
And his name, that sat on him, was Death
And Hell followed with him16Embed"
"Cocaine Blues (At Folsom Prison) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Early one morning while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving .44 beneath my head
Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico

[Verse 2]
Laid in the hot joints, taking the pills
In walked the Sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, ""Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down""
""Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more""
[Verse 3]
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Early next morning 'bout a half past nine
I spied a Sheriff coming down the line
Hocked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, ""Come on you dirty hack into that district court""

[Verse 4]
Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little Judge commence to look about
In about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read, ""In the first degree...""
I hollered, ""Lordy, Lordy, have mercy on me""
The Judge, he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom Pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down

[Outro]
Come all, you've got to listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey, and let that cocaine be
[Spoken Word]
""These men have receptions
Matlock A50632, and Batshelter 83979
They have receptions""

"God’s Gonna Cut You Down Lyrics[Chorus 1]
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

[Verse 1]
Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angel's feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, ""John, go do My will!""
[Chorus 2]
Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter

Well, you may throw your rock, and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter

"A Boy Named Sue Lyrics""I want you to, if you don't mind, Carl, I'd like you to stay out and help us on some songs, play the guitar.""

""I'd love to!""

""One of the greatest guitar players as well as songwriters and singers in the business. Appreciate a little help on the guitar, all right?""

[Verse 1]
Well, my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue.""

[Verse 2]
Well, he must've thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folks
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue.""
[Verse 3]
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

[Verse 4]
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""

[Verse 5]
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!""

[Verse 6]
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer
[Verse 7]
I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

[Verse 8]
And he said: ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong

[Verse 9]
He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue
[Verse 10]
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!10Embed"
"Man in Black Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, you wonder why I always dress in black
Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on

[Verse 2]
I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Living in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the time

[Verse 3]
I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me
[Verse 4]
Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak-of-lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black

[Verse 5]
I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men

[Verse 6]
And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred-thousand who have died
Believing that we all were on their side

[Verse 7]
Well, there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changing everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white

[Verse 8]
Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everything's okay
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
Until things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black7Embed"
"I’ve Been Everywhere Lyrics[Intro]

When along came a semi with a high an' canvas covered load
""If you're goin' to Winnemucca, Mack, with me you can ride""

"One Lyrics[Verse 1]
Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?

[Chorus]
You said one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
It leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, and we're doing it again

You say love is a temple, love the higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you've got
When all you've got is hurt

One life, you've got to do what you should
One life with each other

Ten years ago on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The Judge said, ""Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, you won't have to die""
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
Now the scaffold seemed high, and eternity was near
She stood in the crowd, but she shed not a tear
But some times at night when the cold wind calls
She comes to my grave and she moans o'er my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

"Big River LyricsNow I taught the weeping willow how to cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, Big River
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River, when you called

Then you took me to St. Louis later on down the river
A freighter said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the bluff
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf
She loves you, Big River, more than me

And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, Big River

"Ghost Riders in the Sky Lyrics[Verse 1]
An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies, and up a cloudy draw

[Verse 2]
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny, and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard, and he heard their mournful cry

[Chorus]
Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky
[Verse 3]
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

[Verse 4]
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
""If you want to save your soul from Hell, a-ridin' on our range
Then cowboy, change your ways today, or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies""

[Chorus]
Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky

"Wayfaring Stranger Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelling through this world below
There's no sickness, no toil, nor danger
In that bright land to which I go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm going there to see my Father
And all my loved ones who've gone on

[Chorus]
I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home

[Verse 2]
I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way is hard and steep
But beauteous fields arise before me
Where God's redeemed, their vigils keep
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm going there to see my Mother
She said she'd meet me when I come

So, I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home2Embed"
"I Hung My Head Lyrics[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim
My brother's rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead
[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
I hung my head
I hung my head

[Verse 2: Johnny Cash]
I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head in my hands
The sheriff, he asked me
""Why had I run?""
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
I hung my head
I hung my head

[Verse 3: Johnny Cash]
Here in the courthouse
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury
What verdict they find""
I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead
[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my

Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on the hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain
And he'd come to fetch me
To see what they'd done
And we'll ride together
To kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy
For soon I'll be dead

I hung my head

Where the road is dark and the seed is sowed
Where the gun is cocked and the bullet's cold
Where the miles are marked in the blood and gold
I'll meet you further on up the road
Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring
My lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing

And I'll meet you further on up the road

That charges through the night
Like an orange bolt of lightning
Passing everything in sight
I'm the best pal the Duke boys' ever had
I'm thunder on the highway looking bad, bad, bad

I'm a knight
Like the kind in shining armor
With my polished body gleaming
I'm a fighter and a charmer
If trouble comes your way just ask for me
My friends all know me as the General Lee

I'm the General Lee

I'll never let you down when you're riding with me
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean
Take a look back there

We'll cross the field and we'll be runnin' free
They'll eat dust with compliments of me

I'm a hero
And that's how I'll make you feel
When you're riding shotgun with me
And the law is at your heels
I'm glory bound and when the chase is done
I'll take off through the mountains and have fun, fun, fun

I've got style
Tearing through the curves
With my flag waving proudly to the people that I serve
I'm number 1 and I'll always be
The pride of the South they call the General Lee

"I See a Darkness Lyrics[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
Well, you're my friend
And can you see
Many times we've been out drinking
Many times we've shared our thoughts
But did you ever, ever notice
The kind of thoughts I got?
Well, you know I have a love
A love for everyone I know
And you know I have a drive
To live, I won't let go
But can you see its opposition
Comes rising up sometimes?
That its dreadful and position
Comes blacking in my mind

And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness

Is a hope that somehow you
Can save me from this darkness

Well, I hope that someday, buddy
We have peace in our lives
Together or apart
Alone or with our wives
And we can stop our whoring
And pull the smiles inside
And light it up forever
And never go to sleep
My best unbeaten brother
This isn't all I see

Oh no, I see a darkness
Oh no, I see a darkness
Oh no, I see a darkness
Oh no, I see a darkness

"Cocaine Blues (live) LyricsEarly one mornin' while makin' the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' .44 beneath my head

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico

Laid in the hot joints takin' the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down

Said yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail

Early next mornin' bout a half past nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Up then he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, ""Come on you dirty hack - into that district court""

Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about

In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered, ""Lawdy Lawdy, have mercy on me""

The judge, he smiled as he picked up his pen
99 years in the Folsom pen
99 years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down

Come on you've gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine beEmbed"
"One Piece at a Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
And went to Detroit working on assembly line
The first year they had me putting wheels on Cadillacs
Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
Because I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now getting caught meant getting fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand

[Chorus]
I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'd know it's me when I come through your town
I'm going to ride around in style
I'm going to drive everybody wild
Because I'll have the only one there is around
[Verse 2]
So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox, and with help from my friend
I left that day with a lunchbox full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all of the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts, and bolts, and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home
Now, up to now my plan went all right
Until we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
The transmission was a '53
And the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help from an a-daptor kit
We had that engine running just like a song
Now the headlights, they was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of them come on
The back end looked kind of funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said ""Honey, take me for a spin""
So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughing for blocks around
But up there at the courthouse they didn't laugh
Because to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds
[Chorus]
I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm going to ride around in style
I'm going to drive everybody wild
Because I'll have the only one there is around

[Outro]
Uh, yeah, Red Ryder?
This is the Cotton Mouth
In the Psycho-Billy Cadillac, come on
Huh? This is the Cotton Mouth
And negatory on the cost of this mo-chine, there, Red Ryder
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
Uh, what model is it?
Well, it's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56
'57, '58, '59 automobile
It's a '60, '61, '62, '63, '64, '65, '66, '67

"She Used to Love Me a Lot Lyrics[Verse 1]
I saw her through the window today
She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon Cafe
I started to keep going but something made me stop
She used to love me a lot

She looked lonely and I knew the cure
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought I'd walk on in and I'd give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot

I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said ""where have you been? It's been a while""
She was glad to see me, I could almost read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot
[Hook 1]
She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe I said goodbye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot

[Verse 2]
I remember how good it was back then
And I said ""it's not too late to start again
We could spend the night together, take up where we left off""
She used to love me a lot

But I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
""Yes I'm in need of something, but something you ain't got
But I used to love you a lot""

[Hook 2]
I thought she loved me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe she said goodbye
She just left me standing there, I've never been so shocked
She used to love me a lot

Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more

To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call

"Chicken in Black Lyrics[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
For two long years my head hurt bad
So the doctor checked me and he shook his head
He said, ""I'm sorry to tell you but your body's outlived your brain""
He said, ""I know this doctor in New York son
And he'll fix you up right with a brand new one""
So the head doctor met me when I stepped down off the train
He said, ""We had this bank robber killed last night
His body's shot but his brain's alright
I'll give you a transplant boy, and it'll be okay""
I got my new brain in and I was feeling great
I went right back to Nashville with no headache
But something strange happened when I walked in the bank one day
[Chorus]
I said ""Stick 'em up everybody, I'm robbing this place
Drop all of your money in my guitar case
Don't nobody move and don't nobody reach for that door
A lady said, ""Why, you're Johnny Cash!""
I said, ""No ma'am, I'm the Manhattan Flash
And I am the best bank robber in New York""

Now the other night, Roy Acuff called me
He said, ""John, I'd like for you to do the Opry""
So I went out on the stage, but I couldn't sing
I got into half a verse of ""I Walk The Line""
And something snapped in that head of mine
I yelled, ""Stick 'em up! Gimme your money, your watches, and rings""
Well I called New York and talked to that brain quack
I said, ""Doc, I've got to have my old brain back""
He said, ""I'm sorry there Mr. Cash, but I can't do that""
He said, ""I put your brain in a chicken last Monday
He singing your songs and making lots of money
And I got him signed to a ten year recording contract""
Now friends, if you see me walking down the street
Remember what you see ain't necessarily me
And if I try to hold you up, don't pay me no mind
But when you got ten bucks that you can blow
You ought to catch that Johnny Chicken Show
He's doin' fairs and concert dates all up and down the line

I said ""Stick 'em up everybody, I'm robbing this place
Drop all of your money in my guitar case

"Don’t Take Your Guns to Town Lyrics[Verse 1]
A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself atlast he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered around
And wondered at his final words

"The Wreck of the Old ’97 LyricsThey gave him his orders at Monroe Virginia
Saying Steve you're way behind time
This is not 38 this is old 97
You must put her into Spencer on time

He turned around and said to his black greasy fireman
""Shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Old Mountain
Watch old 97 roll""

And then a telegram came to Washington station
This is how it read:
It said, ""That brave engineer that has run old 97
Is lying down in Danville, dead""

He was going down the grade making 90 miles an hour
His whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam
So now all you pretty ladies you better take a warning
From this time on and learn
Don't you speak hard words to your true lover husband
He may leave you and never returnEmbed"
"Dark as the Dungeon (At Folsom Prison) LyricsOh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Until the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal

Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
Danger is double, pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day...
(Ha ha, no laughing during this song please... It's being recorded, I know. Hell, don't you know it's being recorded?)
...Like a friend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine

And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner digging my bones
Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
Danger is double, pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

""Thank you very much, thank you very much. I'm sorry about that little interruption there, but I just want to tell you that this show is being recorded for an album release on Columbia Records and you can't say 'hell' or 'shit' or anything like that. How's that grab you, Bob?""Embed"
"Give My Love to Rose Lyrics[Verse 1]
I found him by the railroad track this morning
I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said
He said they let me out of prison out in Frisco
For ten long years I've paid for what I've done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son

[Chorus]
Give my love to Rose please, won't you mister?
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose
[Verse 2]
Won't you tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
Because it ain't right that she should live alone
Mister here's a bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
Now don't forget to give my love to Rose

[Chorus]
Give my love to Rose please, won't you mister?
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose7Embed"
"Ragged Old Flag Lyrics[Verse]
I walked through a county courthouse square
On a park bench, an old man was sitting there
I said ""Your old court house is kind of run down""
He said ""Naw, it'll do for our little town""
I said ""Your old flag pole is leaned a little bit""
And that's a ragged old flag you got hanging on it
He said ""Have a seat"", and I sat down
""Is this the first time you've been to our little town?""
I said ""I think it is""
He said ""I don't like to brag, but we're kind of proud of
That Ragged Old Flag
You see, we got a little hole in that flag there
When Washington took it across the Delaware
And It got powder burned the night Francis Scott Key sat watching it
Writing Say Can You See
It got a rip in New Orleans, with Packingham & Jackson
Tugging at its seams
And It almost fell at the Alamo
Beside the Texas flag
But she waved on though
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill
There was Robert E. Lee and Beauregard and Bragg
And the south wind blew hard on
That Ragged Old Flag
On Flanders Field in World War I
She got a big hole from a Bertha Gun
She turned blood red in World War II
She hung limp, and low, a time or two
She was in Korea, Vietnam, She went where she was sent
By her Uncle Sam
She waved from our ships upon the briny foam
And now they've about quit waving back here at home
In her own good land here She's been abused
She's been burned, dishonored, denied an' refused
And the government for which she stands
Has been scandalized throughout out the land
And she's getting thread bare, and she's wearing thin
But she's in good shape, for the shape she's in
Because she's been through the fire before
And I believe she can take a whole lot more""
[Outro]
So we raise her up every morning
And we bring her down slow every night
We don't let her touch the ground
And we fold her up right
On second thought
I do like to brag
Because  I'm mighty proud of
That Ragged Old Flag4Embed"
"The Ballad of Ira Hayes Lyrics[Intro]
Ira Hayes
Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Verse 1]
Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land
Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
Until the white man stole the water rights
And the sparkling water stopped
Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed
[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Bridge]
There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

[Verse 2]
And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Bridge]
Ira Hayes returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored
Everybody shook his hand
[Verse 3]
But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no home, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance?

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Verse 4]
Then Ira started drinking hard
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone!
He died drunk early one morning
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
[Verse 5]
Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died1Embed"

Belinda was mine until the time that I found her
Holdin' Jim
And loving him
Then Sue came along, loved me strong, that's what I thought
Me and Sue
But that died, too

Don't know that I will but until I can find me
A girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man

I've had it to here - being where love's a small word
A part time thing
A paper ring
I know it's been done having one girl who loved me
Right or wrong
Weak or strong

And a girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me

"The Mercy Seat Lyrics[Produced by John Carter Cash and Rick Rubin]

[Intro-Johnny Cash]
It all began when they took me from my home
And put me on Death Row
A crime for which I am totally innocent, you know

[Verse 1--Johnny Cash]
I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood
[Chorus--Johnny Cash]
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die

[Verse 2-Johnny Cash]
I hear stories from the chamber
Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
He died upon the cross
Might I say, it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told
My kill-hand's
Tatooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist
In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold
It's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away
Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied
[Chorus-Johnny Cash]
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die

[Verse 3-Johnny Cash]
And the mercy seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way I'm hopin'
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And any way there was no proof
And I'm not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is glowing
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all these looks of disbelief
A life for a life
And a truth for a truth
And I've got nothing left to loose
And I'm not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is smoking
And I think my head is melting
And in a way that's helping
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And any way I told the truth
But I'm afraid I told a lieEmbed"
"Wanted Man Lyrics[Chorus]
Wanted man in California
Wanted man in Buffalo
Wanted man in Kansas City
Wanted man in Ohio
Wanted man in Mississippi
Wanted man in old Cheyenne
Wherever you might look tonight you might see this wanted man

[Verse]
I might be in Colorado
Or Georgia by the sea
Working for some man who may not know at all who I might be
If you ever see me coming and if you know who I am
Don't you breathe it to nobody because you know I'm on the lamb
Wanted man by Lucy Watson
Wanted man by Jeannie Brown
Wanted man by Nellie Johnson
Wanted man in this next town
I've had all that I wanted of a lot of things I've had
And a lot more than I needed of some things that turned out bad
I got sidetracked in El Paso
Stopped to get myself a map
Went the wrong way in Juarez with Juanita on my lap
Went to sleep in Shreveport
Woke up in Abilene
Wondering why I'm wanted at some town half way in between
Wanted man in Albuquerque
Wanted man in Syracuse
Wanted man in Tallahassee
Wanted man in Baton Rouge
There's somebody set to grab me
Anywhere that I might be
And wherever you might look tonight
You might get a glimpse of me

"San Quentin Lyrics""I was thinking about you guys yesterday. Now, I've been here three times before, and I think I understand a little bit of how you feel about some things. It's none of my business how you feel about some other things, and I don't give a damn about how you feel about some other things. But anyway, I tried to put myself in your place, and I believe this is how I would feel about San Quentin...""

[Verse 1]
San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
You've hosted me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen them die
And long ago I stopped asking why

[Verse 2]
San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and have scarred me through and through
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman, you can't understand

[Verse 3]
San Quentin, what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bent my heart and mind and you warp my soul
And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold
[Verse 4]
San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good

[Outro]
San Quentin, you've been living hell to me

""Thank you very much. One more time? Maybe before we do it, though, if any of the guards are still speaking to me, can I have a glass of water?""

"Rock Island Line Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now this here's a story about the Rock Island Line
Well the Rock Island Line she runs down into New Orleans
There's a big tollgate down there and you know
If you got certain things on board when you go through the tollgate
Well you don't have to pay the man no toll
Well a train driver he pulled up to the tollgate
And a man hollered and asked him what all he had on board and said

[Chorus]
I got livestock
I got livestock
I got cows
I got pigs
I got sheep
I got mules
I got all livestock
[Verse 2]
Well he said you're alright boy you don't have to pay no toll
You can just go right on through so he went on through the tollgate
And as he went through he started picking up a little bit of speed
Picking up a little bit of steam
He got on through he turned and looked back at the man he said

[Chorus]
Well I fooled you
I fooled you
I got pigiron
I got pigiron
I got all pigiron

[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

[Verse 3]
Looked cloudy in the west and it looked like rain
Round the curve came a passenger train
North bound train on a southbound track
He's alright a leaving but he won't be back
[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

[Verse 4]
Oh I may be right and I may be wrong
But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Well the engineer said before he died
There were two more drinks that he'd like to try
Conductor said what could they be
A hot cup of coffee and a cold glass of tea

[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it

How high's the water, mama?
Two feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?

We can make it to the road in a homemade boat
That's the only thing we got left that'll float

"The Junkie’s Prayer LyricsThat bed that I lay on is narrow and cold
This sickness inside me tears at my soul
And the devil awaits me, he calls me his son
For he knows I'm cornered and too weak to run

For I soon must return to my gutter of thrills
Where joy is the needle or a bottle of pills
Where a man welcomes misery like an old friend from home
That he uses and abuses till the misery is gone

My mind's filled with torture my body's in pain
But the needle is warm as it sinks in my vein
Just a matter of seconds then my mind will be free
From the coldness and darkness that dominate me

But the freedom is short lived and then I'm alone
I must find the pusher but my money's all gone
Then the cycle of horror starts over once more
Oh God, let me suffer this misery no moreEmbed"
"Danny Boy Lyrics[Verse]
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses fallin'
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide
But come yet back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so
But if you come, when all the flowers are dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ""ave"" there for me
And I will know, though soft you tread above me
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be
And you'll bend down and tell me that you love me
And I will rest in peace until you come to me2Embed"
"Streets of Laredo LyricsAs I walked out on the streets of Laredo
As I walked out on Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay
""I can see by your outfit that you are a cowboy""
These words he did say as I boldly walked by
""Come and sit down beside me and hear my sad story
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die""

""It was once in the saddle, I used to go dashing
Once in the saddle, I used to go gay
First to the card-house and then down to Rose's
But I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today
Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin
Six dance-hall maidens to bear up my pall
Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin
Roses to deaden the clods as they fall""
""Then beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong""

""Then go write a letter to my grey-haired mother
And tell her the cowboy that she loved has gone
But please not one word of the man who had killed me
Don't mention his name and his name will pass on""
When this he had spoken, the hot sun was setting
The streets of Laredo grew cold as the clay
We took the young cowboy down to the green valley
And there stands his marker we made to this day
We beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as we carried him along
Down in the green valley, lay the sod over him
He was a young cowboy and he said he'd done wrong4Embed"
"The Beast in Me LyricsThe beast in me is caged by frail and fragile bars
Restless by day and by night rants and rages at the stars
God help the beast in me

The beast in me has had to learn to live with pain
And how to shelter from the rain
And in the twinkling of an eye, might have to be restrained
God help the beast in me

Sometimes it tries to kid me
That it's just a teddy bear
And even somehow manage to vanish in the air
And that is when I must beware of the beast in me

That everybody knows
They've seen him out dressed in my clothes
Patently unclear if it's New York or New Year

"Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down LyricsWell I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way
On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl that he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed thru the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' downEmbed"

"The Wanderer Lyrics[Verse 1]
I went out walking through the streets paved with gold
Lifted some stones
Saw the skin and bones
Of a city without a soul
I went out walking under an atomic sky
Where the ground won't turn
And the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye

[Chorus]
Yeah I went with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering
I went drifting through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk
Or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in
[Verse 2]
I stopped outside a church house
Where the citizens like to sit
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I went out with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering
I went out walking
Down that winding road
Where no one's trusting no one
And conscience a too heavy load
I went out riding, down that ol'eight lane
I passed by a thousand signs
Looking for my own name

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I went with nothing
But the thought you'd be there, too
Looking for you
I went out there in search of experience
To taste and to touch and to feel's as much
As a man can before he repents
I went out searching, looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who could sit at his father's right hand
I went out walking with a bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one
Now Jesus, don't you wait up
Jesus, I'll be home soon
Yea I went out for the papers
Told her I'd be back by noon
Yeah I left with nothing
But the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you
Yeah I left with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wanderingEmbed"
"Daddy Sang Bass LyricsI remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people, that's all we were
Trying to make a living out of black land dirt
We'd get together in a family circle singing loud

Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm going to join the family circle at the throne
No, the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Now I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singing for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But, I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

"Ballad of a Teenage Queen Lyrics[Intro]
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(Prettiest girl we've ever seen)

[Verse 1]
There's a story in our town
Of the prettiest girl around
Golden hair and eyes of blue
How those eyes could flash at you
(How those eyes could flash at you)
Boys hung around her by the score
But she loved the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(Prettiest girl we've ever seen)
[Verse 2]
She was tops in all they said
It never once went to her head
She had everything it seems
Not a care, this teenage queen
(Not a care, this teenage queen)
Other boys could offer more
But she loved the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(You should be a movie queen)

[Verse 3]
He would marry her next spring
Saved his money, bought a ring
Then one day a movie scout
Came to town to take her out
(Came to town to take her out)
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door
Working at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(See you on the movie screen)

[Verse 4]
Very soon she was a star
Pretty house and shiny car
Swimming pool and a fence around
But she missed her old home town
(But she missed her old home town)
All the world was at her door
All except the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(Saddest girl we've ever seen)
[Verse 5]
Then one day the teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame
Left it all and caught a train
(Left it all and caught a train)
Do I have to tell you more
She came back to the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store

You'll hear it all at the candy store)1Embed"
"The One on the Right Is on the Left LyricsThere once was a musical troupe
A picking, singing folk group
They sang the mountain ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They were long on musical ability
Folks thought they would go far
But political incompatibility led to their downfall

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear was a Methodist

This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
Singing the traditional ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They performed with great virtuosity
And soon they were the rage
But political animosity prevailed upon the stage
Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license

Well the curtain had ascended
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered
To hear the folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously
They had a free-for-all

Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy in the rear said, ""Oh dear""

Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
Don't go mixing politics with the folk songs of our land
Just work on harmony and diction
Play your banjo well
And if you have political convictions
Keep them to yourself
Now, the one on the left works in a bank
And the one in the middle drives a truck
The one on the right's an all-night deejay
And the guy in the rear got drafted1Embed"
"My Grandfather’s Clock Lyrics[Verse]
My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died
Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died
My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound
And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died
It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come
Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died
Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped short, never to go again
When the old man diedEmbed"
"Redemption Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've wept for those who suffer long
But how I weep for those who've gone
Into rooms of grief and questioned wrong
But keep on killing
It's in the soul to feel such things
But weak to watch without speaking
Oh what mercy sadness brings
If God be willing

[Chorus]
There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day
[Verse 2]
Fire rages in the streets
And swallows everything it meets
It's just an image often seen
On television
Come leaders, come you men of great
Let us hear you pontificate
Your many virtues laid to waste
And we aren't listening

[Chorus]
There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day

[Verse 3]
What do you have for us today
Throw us a bone but save the plate
On why we waited until so late
Was there no oil to excavate
No riches in trade for the fate
Of every person who died in hate
Throw us a bone, you men of great
[Chorus]
There is a train that's heading straight
To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate
And on the way, child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day

[Outro]
It's buried in the countryside
It's exploding in the shells at night
It's everywhere a baby cries
Freedom

"In My Life Lyrics[Verse]
There are places I'll remember
All my life
Though some have changed
Some forever
Not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life
I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one
Compares with you
And these memories
Lose their meaning
When I think of love
As something new
[Chorus]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more
In my life
I love you more3Embed"
"Big Iron LyricsTo the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came ridin' from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more
Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
He was an Arizona Ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter, he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from their windows, everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
Was about to meet his death

There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
The big iron on his hip

Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
The big iron on his hipEmbed"
"A Thing Called Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Six foot six he stood on the ground
He weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down
To his knees by love
He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup
Because of love

[Chorus]
You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love
It can lift you up never let you down
Take your world and turn it around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found
That's stronger than love
[Verse 2]
Most men are like me, they struggle and doubt
They trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with living to worry about
A little word like love
But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I thank God that the world's been blessed
With a thing called love

[Chorus]
You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love
It can lift you up never let you down
Take your world and turn it around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found
That's stronger than love2Embed"

Well you ask me if I'll forget my baby
I guess I will, someday
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll get along
I guess I will, someway
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

"I Was There When It Happened Lyrics[Verse 1]
There are some people who say we cannot tell
Whether we are saved or whether all is well
They say we only can hope and trust that it is so
Well, I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know

[Chorus 1]
Yes, I know when Jesus saved me (Saved my soul)
The very moment He forgave me (Made me whole)
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within (Peace within)

Satan can't make me doubt it (I won't doubt it)
It's real and I'm going to shout it (I'm going to shout it)
I was there when it happened
And so I guess I ought to know

I don't care who tells me salvation is not real
Though the world may argue, that we cannot feel
The heavy burden's lifted and the vile sins go
I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know

Yes, I know when Jesus saved me (Saved my soul)
The very moment He forgave me (Made me whole)
He took away my heavy burdens

Hey porter, hey porter!
Would you tell me the time?
How much longer will it be 'til we cross
That Mason-Dixon Line?
At daylight, would ya tell that engineer
To slow it down?
Or better still, just stop the train
'cause I want to look around

[Verse 2]
Hey porter, hey porter!
What time did you say?
How much longer will it be 'til I
Can see the light of day?
When we hit Dixie, will you tell that engineer
To ring his bell?
And ask everybody that ain't asleep
To stand right up and yell
[Verse 3]
Hey porter, hey porter!
It's getting light outside
This old train is puffing smoke
And I have to strain my eyes
But ask that engineer if he
Will blow his whistle please
'Cause I smell frost on cotton leaves
And I feel that Southern breeze

[Verse 4]
Hey porter, hey porter!
Please get my bags for me
I need nobody to tell me now
That we're in Tennessee
Go tell that engineer to make
That lonesome whistle scream
We're not so far from home
So take it easy on the steam

Hey porter, hey porter!
Please open up the door
When they stop the train, I'm gonna get off first

And I didn't mind the fare
I'm going to set my feet on Southern soil
And breathe that Southern air2Embed"

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
You been out riding fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasing you
Can hurt you somehow

[Chorus 1]
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
Know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the things that you can't get

Desperado, oh, you aren't getting any younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're driving you home
And freedom, oh freedom
Well, that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking
Through this world all alone

[Chorus 2]
And don't your feet get cold in the winter time
The sky won't snow, the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losing all your highs and lows
Isn't it funny how the feeling
Goes away

[Verse 3]
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences, and open the gate
It may be raining, but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you

"What Is Truth Lyrics[Verse 1]
The old man turned off the radio
Said, ""Where did all of the old songs go?""
""Kids sure play funny music these days!""
""They play it in the strangest ways.""
Said, ""It looks to me like they've all gone wild.""
""It was peaceful back when I was a child""
Well, man, could it be that the girls and boys
Are trying to be heard above your noise?
And the lonely voice of youth cries
""What is truth?""

[Verse 2]
A little boy of three sitting on the floor
Looks up and says, ""Daddy, what is war?""
""Son, that's when people fight and die.""
The little boy of three says, ""Daddy, why?""
A young man of seventeen in Sunday school
Being taught the golden rule
And by the time another year has gone around
It may be his turn to lay his life down
Can you blame the voice of youth for asking
""What is truth?""

[Verse 3]
A young man sitting on the witness stand
The man with the book says - ""Raise your hand!""
""Repeat after me, I solemnly swear""
The man looked down at his long hair
And although the young man solemnly swore
Nobody seems to hear anymore
And it didn't really matter if the truth was there
It was the cut of his clothes and the length of his hair
And the lonely voice of youth cries
""What is truth?""

[Verse 4]
The young girl dancing to the latest beat
Has found new ways to move her feet
The young man speaking in the city square
Is trying to tell somebody that he cares
Yeah, the ones that you're calling wild
Are going to be the leaders in a little while
This old world's waking to a new born day
And I solemnly swear that it'll be their way
You better help the voice of youth find
What is truth?

And the lonely voice of youth cries
What is truth?4Embed"
"The Lily of the Valley LyricsI have found a friend in Jesus, He's everything to me
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
He's the Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole

In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay
And He tells me every care on Him to roll
He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star

He will never, never leave me nor yet forsake me here
While I live by faith and do His blessed will
There's a wall of fire about me and I've nothing now to fear
With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill

And then sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll

"Father and Son Lyrics[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
It's not time to make a change
Just relax and take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want, you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Why think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

How can I try to explain
When I do he turns away again
It's always been the same, the same old story
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
There's a way and I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go

It's not time to make a change
Just sit down, take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

All the times that I cried
Keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it

But it's them you know not me
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away

"Tennessee Stud LyricsBack about eighteen and twenty-five
I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would've made it through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been riding on a Tennessee stud

Had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I wrote a letter to my Uncle Fud
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud

[Chorus]
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like the Tennessee stud
Drifted on down into no man's land
I crossed the river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with a Spaniard's foe
'Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold

Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud

[Chorus]
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like the Tennessee stud

I rode right back across Arkansas
I whipped her brother and I whipped her Pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
She was riding on a Tennessee mare

Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
Little horse colt playing 'round the door
I loved the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mare
[Chorus]
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like the Tennessee studEmbed"
"The Legend of John Henry’s Hammer Lyrics[Verse]
John Henry's Papy woke him up one midnight
He said before the sheriff comes I wanna tell you, listen boy
Said learn to ball a jack, learn to lay a track, learn to pick and shovel too, and take my hammer, it'll do anything you tell it to
John Hery's mammie had about a dozen babies, John Henry's papie told tale about a dozen times
The babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money, he said I'll pay you quarter at a time, startin' tomorow, that's the pay for a steel driver on this line
Then the section foreman said hey hammer swinger, I see you brought your own hammer boy, but what else can all those muscles do?
And he said, I can turn a jack, I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too
(can you swing a hammer boy?)
I can I'll do anything you hire me to
Now ain't you something so high and mighty with your muscles, just go ahead pick up that hammer, pick up the hammer
He said get a rusty spike and swing it down three times, I'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to, go on and do what you say you can do
With a steep nose hammer on a four foot switch panel, John Henry raised it back till it touched his heels, then the spike went through the cross tie and it split it half in two, 35 cents a day for driven steel
(sweat sweat boy, sweat, you owe me two more swings)
I was born for driven steel
Well John Henry hammered in the mountain, he'd give a grunt and he'd give groan with every swing, the women folks for miles around, heard him and come down, to watch him make the cold steel ring, Lord what a swinger, just listen to that cold steel ring
But the bad boss come up laughing at John Henry, said you full of vinegar now, but you bout through, were gonna get a steam drill to do your share of drivin, then what's all them muscles gonna do, huh John Henry, gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you
John Henry said I feed four little brothers, and my baby sister's walking on her knees, did the Lord say that machines awtta take the place of living, and what's a subsitute for bread and beans, I ain't seen it, do engines get rewarded for their steam
John Henry hid in a coal mine for his dinner now, had thirty minutes to rest before the bell, the mine boss hollered get up whoever you are and get a pick ax, give me enough coal to start another hill, and keep it burning, mine me enough to start another hill
John Henry said to his captain, a man ain't nothin but a man, but if you bring that steam drill round, I'll beat it fair and honest, I'll die with my hammer in my hand, but I'll be laughing, cuz you can't replace a steel driven man
There was a big crowd of people at the mountain, John Henry said to the steam drill how is you, pardon me mister steam drill, I suppose you didn't hear me, I said how you, well can you turn a jack, can you lay a track, can you pick and shovel too, listen this hammer swingers talkin' to you
2000 people hollered go John Henry, then somebody hollered the mountain's caving in, John Henry told the captain, tell the kind folks not to worry, that ain't nothin but my hammer suckin' wind, keeps me breathing, a steel drivers muscle I intend
Captain tell the people move back further, I'm at the finish line and I ain't no drill, she's so far behind you ain't got the brains to quit it, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills, Lord Lordy, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills
Well John Henry had a little woman, I believe the lady's name was Polly Ann, yeah that was his good woman, John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home, he layed down to rest his weary back and early next morining he said come here Polly Ann come here sugar, ya know I believe this is the first time I ever watched the sun come up that I couldn't come up with it
Take my hammer Polly Ann and go to that rail road, swing that hammer like you seen me do it, and when your swinging with the lead men, they'll all know they'll all know your John Henry's woman, but tell them that's not all I can do, tell em I can hoist a jack, and I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too, ain't no machine can, that's been proved to you
There was a big crowd of mourners at the church house, the section hands laid him in the sand, trains go by on the rails John Henry laid, they slow down and take off their hats, the men do, when they come to the palce John Henrys laid, rests on his back, some say mornin steel driver you sure were a hammer swinger, then they go along pickin up speed, clikty clak, clikty clak, down there lies a steel driven man oh Lord, down there lies a steel driven man, down there lies a steel driven man oh Lord, down there lies a steel driven man1Embed"

My name is Joe Roberts, I work for the state
I'm a sergeant out on Perenville barracks number 8
I've always done an honest job, honest as I could
Got a brother named Frankie, Frankie isn't no good
Ever since we were young kids, it's been the same come down
I'd get a call on the short wave, Frankie's in trouble downtown
Well, if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away
But sometimes when it's your brother, you look the other way

Yeah, me and Frankie laughing and drinking, nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria while the band played ""The Night of the Johnstown Flood""

Man turns his back on his family, he ain't no good

Well, Frankie went into the army back in 1965
I got a farm deferment, settled down, took Maria for my wife
But them wheat prices kept on dropping, until it was like we's getting robbed
Frankie came home in '68, and me, I took this job

[Chorus]
Yeah, me and Frankie laughing and drinking, nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria while the band played ""The Night of the Johnstown Flood""
I catch him when he's straying, teach him how to walk that line
Man turns his back on his family, ain't no friend of mine

[Verse 3]
The night was like any other, I got a call about a quarter to nine
There was trouble at a roadhouse out on the Michigan line
There was a kid on the floor, looking bad, bleeding hard from his head
There was a girl crying at a table, it was Frankie, she said
I ran out and I jumped in my car, then I hit the lights
I must have done about a hundred and ten to Michigan County that night
It was down by the crossroads, out by willow bank
Seen the Buick with Ohio plates, behind the wheel was Frank
Well, I chased him through them county roads, until the sign said Canadian border five miles from here
Pulled over to the side out the highway, watched the taillights disappear

[Chorus]
Yeah, me and Frankie laughing and drinking, nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria while the band played ""The Night of the Johnstown Flood""
I catch him when he's straying, like any brother should
Man turns his back on his family, he ain't no goodEmbed"

But the strangest of them all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Staring at the wall
Staring at the wall
In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote
Proving crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole for
Namin' their wedding day
Namin' their wedding day

As he looked at the wall
So strong and tall
I heard him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm going to be the first
I'm going to be the first
Then the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
Because there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall
If you ever touch that wall
Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall
He never made that wall
Well there's never been a man who shook this camp
But I knew a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was suicide
I know it was suicide2Embed"
"Cocaine Blues LyricsEarly one morning while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head

Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico
Laid in the hot joints taking the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willie Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hop that shot your woman down

I said yes sir, my name is Willie Lee
If you got a warrant, just read it to me
Shot her down because she made me sorе
I thought I was her daddy but she had five morе
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on train and it took me back
I had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail

Got up next morning about a half past nine
Spied a sheriff coming down the line
Hopped and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, come on you dirty hop into that district court

Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before that jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about

In about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered, lordy lordy, have mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot my woman down

Come on you hops and listen unto me

Saw my first pistol in the general store
In the general store, when I was thirteen
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen
I asked if I could have one when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs and she really blew up
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

My very first pistol was a cap-and-ball Colt
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
It loads a mite slow and I soon found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
Then I went and bought myself a Colt .45
Called a Peacemaker but I didn't know why
I never knew why and I didn't understand
'Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
I never knew why, I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

I got into a card game in a company town
Caught a miner cheating and I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down, watched the dog fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right handEmbed"
"Out Among the Stars Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's midnight at a liquor store in Texas
Closing time another day is done
When a boy walked in the door and points a pistol
He can't find a job, but Lord, he's found a gun
He pulls it off with no trace of confrontation
Then he lets the old man run out in the street
Even though he knows they'll come with guns a blazing
Already he can feel a great relief

[Chorus]
Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars?
[Verse 2]
He pictures the arrival of the cruisers
Sees that old familiar anger in their eyes
He knows that when they're shooting at this loser
They'll be aiming at the demons in their lives

[Chorus]
Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

[Verse 3]
The evening news carried all the details
He dies in every living room in town
In his own a bottle's thrown in anger
And his father cries, he'll never live this down

[Chorus]
Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

And fly like eagles out among the stars?3Embed"
"Delia’s Gone Lyrics[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse]
Delia, oh, Delia Delia all my life
If I hadn't have shot poor
Delia I'd have had her for my wife
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

I went up to Memphis
And I met Delia there found her in her parlor
And I tied to her chair
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

She was low down and trifling
And she was cold and mean
Kind of evil make me want to Grab my sub machine
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
First time I shot her I shot her in the side
Hard to watch her suffer
But with the second shot she died
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

But jailer, oh, jailer Jailer
I can't sleep 'cause all around my bedside
I hear the patter of Delia's feet
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

So if you woman's devilish
You can let her run
Or you can bring her down and do her
Like Delia got done
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's goneEmbed"

"Folsom Prison Blues (At Folsom Prison) Lyrics""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.""

I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

SooooEEEE!!

I bet there's rich folks eating from a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin' and that's what tortures me
Well if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues awayEmbed"
"It’s All Over LyricsI was on my way to you and I was worried
I was all torn up and nervous cause I knew that you'd be gone
I knocked and crossed my fingers while I waited
And I couldn't hold the teardrops when I walked away alone

It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed it's all over
Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed it's all over
Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go

I'd been runnin' 'round in circles like a baby
I was in a daze because I loved you so, I couldn't see
I was broken in a million little pieces
When I saw enough to realize, you didn't care for me

It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed
Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
It's all over, it's all over, so forget her
Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go, let her go, boy
Let her goEmbed"
"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face Lyrics[Verse]
The first time ever I saw your face, I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless sky, my love
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move through my hands
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command
And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I know our joy would fill the earth
And last till the end of time, my love

"If I Told You Who It Was Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was down in music city 'bout a week ago
I wanted to see the brand old Loper show
So I held a cap and I headed down to Opryland
They said they sold their last ticket the day before
So I kinda just hung around the backstage door
And down the steps she came, man oh man
My favourite female country star
She waved her fans and headed for her car
Her tire, unlike her body, was very flat
She said, could you change my tire
I said your wish is my desire
As she raised the lid, I grabbed her bumper jack
She said I sure do appreciate you changing my tire

[Chorus]
If I told you who it was, if I told you who it was
You'd say I was making it up
You've seen her on the screen and in country magazines
You'd think I was making it up
She said it was our little secret and by golly
I'm gonna keep it
Anyway you wouldn't believe it
If I told you who it was
[Verse 2]
She said you need a lift and I said well
You can drop me of at the York motel
So we headed down Briley parkway in the town
I told her I got all your records ma'am
She smiled and said well I be damned
She said, you're kind of cute fella, wanna mess around
When we got to my room just the people lied
I said sure wish I could've heard you sing tonight
She smiled at me and said what do you wanna hear?
Well if I was one of them country music folks
I'll tell you, she'd sure get my vote for the best performance of the year

[Chorus]
If I told you who it was, if I told you who it was
You'd say I was making it up
You've seen her on the screen and in country magazines
You'd think I was making it up
She said it was our little secret and by golly
I'm gonna keep it
Anyway you wouldn't believe it
If I told you who it was

[Verse 2]
Well I tell you this much
When I put my arms around her and squeezed her real tight
She looked up at me with those big beautiful eyes
Took a deep breath and a sigh and said:
""Howdy I'm just so proud to be here!""
[Chorus]
If I told you who it was, if I told you who it was
You'd say I was making it up
You've seen her on the screen and in country magazines

She said it was our little secret and by golly
I'm gonna keep it
Anyway you wouldn't believe it

Country boy, ain't got no shoes
Country boy, ain't got no blues
Well, you work all day
While you're wanting to play
In the sun and the sand
With a face that's tan
But at the end of the day
When your work is done
You ain't got nothing but fun

[Chorus 1]
Country boy, ain't got no ills
Country boy, don't owe no bills

And then you watch him squirm
While you put him on a hook
And you drop him in a brook
And if everything's gonna turn out right
You're gonna fry fish tonight

Country boy, you're lucky free
Country boy, I wish I was you, and you was me

Country boy, got work to do
Country boy, in the morning dew

You got to plant the seeds

You know you gotta hoe
But when it's quittin' time
And your work is through
There's a lot of life in you

[Verse 3]
Country boy, you got a shaggy dog
Country boy, up a holler log
Well, he comes in a run
When you pick up your gun
And with a shell or two
And your dog and you
When you get your rabbit
You'll skin his hide
He's gonna be good fried

Country boy, got a lot to lose
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoesEmbed"

These are my people this is the land where my forefathers lie
These are my people in brotherhood we're heirs of a creed to live by
A creed that proclaims that by loved ones blood stains

These are my people that a light of the earth you can tell they are ours
A new step to take and a new day will break

Bad luck wind been blowing at my back
I was born to bring trouble to wherever I'm at

When the ink starts to itch, then the black will turn to red

I was born in the soul of misery
Never had me a name
They just gave me the number when I was young

Got a long line of heartache, I carry it well
The list of lives I've broken reach from here to hell
Bad luck wind been blowing at my back
I pray you don't look at me, I pray I don't look back

It should be a while before I see Dr. Death
So it would sure be nice if I could get my breath
Well I'm not the crying nor the whining kind
Until I hear the whistle of the 309

Of the 309, of the 309
Put me in my box on the 309

Take me to the depot, put me to bed
Blow an electric fan on my gnarly old head
Everybody take a look, see I'm doing fine
Then load my box on the 309

[Verse 3]
Hey sweet baby, kiss me hard
Draw my bath water, sweep my yard
Give a drink of my wine to my Jersey cow
I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for my journey now
On the 309, on the 309
I hear the sound of a railroad train
The whistle blows and I'm gone again
It will take me higher than a Georgia pine
Stand back children, it's a 309

[Verse 4]
A chicken in the pot and turkey in the corn
Ain't felt this good since jubilee morn
Talk about luck, well I got mine
Asthma coming down like a 309
Write me a letter, sing me a song
Tell me all about it, what I did wrong
Meanwhile I will be doing fine
Then load my box on the 309

Morning found me lying on a floor in New Orleans
Looking like the patches was about to eat my jeans
Feeling like my belly was a warehouse for the blues
And I sure miss my sweet Cocaine Carolina
Met her on an ocean liner, called her Cocaine Carolina
She was quite a lady then and I was twenty two
God knows how much I adored her, I just never could afford her
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?

So goodbye Cocaine Carolina, you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag, she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?

Oh someone said if I was lucky I could go back to Kentucky
Lexington was famous for it's bluegrass and its hills

Maybe I should go to California

(Away, away, away rolled the rebel Johnny Yuma, Johnny Yuma)

Johnny Yuma was a rebel
He roamed through the West
Did Johnny Yuma, the rebel
He wandered alone

He got fighting mad this rebel lad
He packed no star as he wandered far
Where the only law was a hook and a draw
The rebel, Johnny Yuma

He was panther quick and leather tough
If he figured that he'd been pushed enough

"Goin’ by the Book Lyrics[Verse 1]
You can see it in the movies and the paper and the TV news
Somebody's army is always on the move
There's going to be a battle the lines have been drawn
They have got guns and tanks and planes
The wells are gone dry and the water is bad and the air is acid rain
There's war after war and rumors of war from the east
There's a rumbling in the ground and they are talking about the beast
Good mothers cry cause the rivers run high
With the blood of too many sons
Some people say peace is on the way
But the worst is still to come

[Chorus]
Because the prophets wrote about it
And Jesus spoke about it
And John got to take a look
And he told us what he saw when it's easy to see
It's going by the book
[Verse 2]
There's armies in the cities and the missiles stand ready for flight
A pale horse rides like the wind across the night
And that rumbling in the desert like thunder getting closer
Are the trumpet's getting ready to blow
There's going to be a shout that will wake the dead we better be ready to go

"(Ghost) Rider in the Sky LyricsAn old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the Riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie yi ooh
Yippie yi yay
Ghost Riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from Hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies

Yippie yi ooh
Yippie yi yay

Ghost Riders in the sky

"If You Could Read My Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains around my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as there's a ghost that you can't see

[Verse 2]
If I could read your mind, love
What a tale your thoughts would tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind the drugstores sell
When you reached the part where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
But heroes often fail
You won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take!
[Verse 3]
I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three way script
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now, love, let's be real
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone
And I just can't get it back

If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie

But stories always end
If you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just trying to understand
The feelings that you lack

I don't know where we went wrong

Just around the corner there's heartache
Down the street that losers use

Memories so sweet that I cry

So if you just lost your sweetheart
And it seems there's no good way to choose
Come along with me misery loves company

"The Man Who Couldn’t Cry LyricsThere once was a man who just couldn't cry
He hadn't cried for years and for years
Napalmed babies and movie love stories
For instance, could not produce tears

As a child he had cried as all children will
Then at some point, his tear ducts ran dry
Grew to be a man, it all hit the fan
Things got bad but he couldn't cry

His dog was run over, his wife up and left him
After that he got sacked from his job
Lost his arm in a war, was laughed at by a whore
Ah, but still not a sniffle or sob

His novel was refused and his movie was panned
His big Broadway show was a flop
He got sent off to jail, you guessed it, no bail
Oh, but still not a dribble or drop
In jail he was beaten, bullied and buggered
And made to make license plates
Water and bread was all he was fed
Not once did a tear stain his face

Doctors were called in, scientists too
Theologians were last and practically least
They all agreed sure enough, this was no cream puff
But in fact an insensitive beast

He was taken from jail and placed in a place
For the insensitive and the insane
He made a lot of friends and he played a lot of chess
And he wept every time it would rain

Once it rained forty days and it rained forty nights
And he cried and he cried and he cried and he cried
On the forty-first day, he passed away
He just dehydrated and died
He went up to heaven, located his dog
After that, he rejoined his arm
Below, all the critics, they took it all back
Cancer robbed the whore of her charm

His ex-wife died of stretch marks, his ex-employer went broke
The theologians were finally found out
Right down to the ground, the old jailhouse burned down
And the earth suffered perpetual droughtEmbed"

[Verse 3]
Oh, I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I went back home, the home was lonesome
Since my mother, she was gone
All my brothers and sisters crying
What a home so sad and alone

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
We sang songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that mother maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along

"Redemption LyricsFrom his hands it came down, from the side it came down
From the feet it came down and ran to the ground
Between heaven and hell, a teardrop fell
In the deep crimson dew, the tree of life grew

[Chorus]
And the blood gave life to the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price that set the captives free
And the numbers that came through the fire and the flood
Clung to the tree and were redeemed by the blood

From the tree streamed a light that started the fight
'Round the tree grew a vine on whose fruit I could dine
My old friend Lucifer came, fought to keep me in chains
But I saw through the tricks of six-sixty-six
[Chorus]
And the blood gave life to the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price that set the captives free
And the numbers that came through the fire and the flood
Clung to the tree and were redeemed by the blood

From his hands it came down, from his side it came down
From his feet it came down and ran to the ground
And a small inner voice said ""you do have a choice""
The vine engrafted me and I clung to the tree2Embed"
"Drive On Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got a friend named Whiskey Sam
He was my boonierat buddy for a year in 'Nam
He said is my country just a little off track
Took them twenty-five years to welcome me back

[Verse 2]
But, it's better than not coming back at all
Many a good man I saw fall
And even now, every time I dream
I hear the men and the monkeys in the jungle scream

[Chorus]
Drive on, it don't mean nothing
My children love me, but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man, drive on
It don't mean nothing, drive on
[Verse 3]
I remember one night, Tex and me
Rappelled in on a hot L.Z
We had our 16's on rock and roll
But with all that fire, I was scared and cold

[Verse 4]
I was crazy and I was wild
And I have seen the tiger smile
I spit in a bamboo viper's face
And I'd be dead but by God's grace

[Chorus]
Drive on, it don't mean nothing
My children love me, but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man, drive on
It don't mean nothing, it don't mean nothing, drive on

[Verse 5]
It was a real slow walk in a sad rain
And nobody tried to be John Wayne
I came home but Tex did not
And I can't talk about the hit he got

[Verse 6]
But I got a little limp now when I walk
And I got a little tremolo when I talk
But my letter read from Whiskey Sam
You're a walking, talking miracle from Vietnam
[Chorus]
Drive on, it don't mean nothing
My children love me, but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man, drive on
It don't mean nothing, it don't mean nothing, drive on2Embed"
"The Ballad of Casey Jones LyricsCome all you rounders if you wanna hear the story about a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the roller's name on a 68 wheeler course he won his fame
Caller called Casey bout half past four he kissed his wife at the station door
He climbed in the cabin with his orders in his hand
Said this is the trip to the Promised Land
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin Casey Jones orders in his hand
Casey Jones leanin' out the window taking a trip to the Promised Land

Through South Memphis Yards on a fly rain been a fallin' and the water was high
Everybody knew by the engine's moan that the man at the throttle was Casey Jones
Well Jones said fireman now don't you fret Sam Webb said we ain't a givin' up yet

Dead on the rail was a passenger train blood was a boilin' in Casey's brain
Casey said hey now look out ahead jump Sam jump or we'll all be dead
With a hand on a whistle and a hand on a brake north Mississippi was wide awake
I see railroad official said he's a good engineer to be a laying dead
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin...
Headaches and heartaches and all kinds of pain all the part of a railroad train
Sweat and toil the good and the grand part of the life of a railroad man
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin...Embed"

Well he's not very handsome to look at
Oh he's shaggy and eats like a hog
And he's always killing my chickens
That dirty old egg-sucking dog
Egg-sucking dog
I'm gonna stomp your head in the ground
If you don't stay out of my hen house
You dirty old egg-sucking hound
Now if he don't stop eating my eggs up
Though I'm not a real bad guy
I'm going to get my rifle and send him
To that great chicken house in the sky

But you'd better stay out of my hen house

"I Saw a Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamed an angel came
He took my hand, he called my name
He bid me look the other way
I saw a man, I heard him say

[Chorus]
He said if I be lifted up
I'll draw all men to me
He turned and then I saw
The nail-scarred hands
That bled for me
I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there

My life my heart I gave
My soul was in his care

When I awoke my heart beat so and in the dark I saw a glow
This was no dream he turned my way

"Far Side Banks of Jordan Lyrics[Verse 1: Johnny]
I believe my steps are growing wearier each day
Still I've got another journey on my mind
Lures of this old world have ceased to make me want to stay
And my one regret is leaving you behind

[Verse 2: June]
But if it proves to be His will that I am first to cross
And somehow I've a feeling it will be
When it comes your time to travel likewise, don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll see

And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be sitting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming, I will rise up with a shout
And come running through the shallow water, reaching for your hand

Through this life we've laboured hard to earn our meager fare
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes

So I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away
Until you come, then we'll see paradise

"Tennessee Flat-Top Box Lyrics[Verse]
In a little cabaret in a South Texas border town
Sat a boy and his guitar
And the people came from miles around
And all the girls from there to Austin
Were slipping away from home and putting jewelery in hock
To take the trip, to go and listen
To the little dark-haired boy
That played the Tennessee flat top box
And he would play

Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle
And he never cared to make a dime
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time
And all the girls from nine to ninety
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes
And begging him don't stop
And hypnotized and fascinated
By the little dark-haired boy
That played the Tennessee flat top box
And he would play
Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him around
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town
But all the girls still dreamed about him
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked
And then one day on the Hit Parade
Was a little dark-haired boy
That played the Tennessee flat top box

[Outro]
And he would playEmbed"
"Understand Your Man Lyrics[Verse]
Don’t call my name out your window, I’m leaving
I won’t even turn my head
Don’t send your kinfolk to give me no talking
I’ll be gone, like I said
You’d just say the same old things
That you be saying all along
Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut
Till I’m gone
Don’t give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan
Understand your man
I'm tired of your bad mouthing
Understand your man

Now, you can give my other suit to the Salvation Army
And everything else I leave behind
I ain't taking nothing that'll slow down my traveling
While I'm untangling my mind
I ain't going to repeat what i said anymore
While I'm breathing air that ain't been breathed before
I'll be as gone to as a wild goose in winter
Then you'll understand your man
Meditate on it
Understand your man
You hear me talking now
Understand your man
Remember what i told ya
Understand your man1Embed"

And every time my Cindy passed, she'd take a little bite of me

Well, Cindy is my honey the sweetest in the south
When we kissed to bees would all swarm around her mouth

I'd sew my Cindy to my side and down the road I'd go

Well, Cindy got religion. She'd had it once before

If I can't have the gal I want I won't have none at all

"A Satisfied Mind Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
How many times have
You heard someone say
If I had his money
I could do things my way

[Chorus]
But little they know
That it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten
With a satisfied mind

[Verse]
Once I was winning
In fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for
To get a start in life's game
Then suddenly it happened
I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far
With a satisfied mind
Money can't buy back
Your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person
Is a pauper at times
Compared to the man
With a satisfied mind

When my life has ended
And my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones
I'll leave there's no doubt
But one thing's for certain
When it comes my time
I'll leave this old world
With a satisfied mind

From the backdoor of your life you swept me out dear
In the bread line of your dreams I lost my place
At the table of your love I got the brush off
At the Indianapolis of your heart I lost the race

I've been washed down the sink of your conscience
In the theater of your love I lost my part
And now you say you've got me out of your conscience
I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart

In the garbage disposal of your dreams I've been ground up dear
On the river of your plans I'm up the creek
Up the elevator of your future I've been shafted
On the calendar of your events I'm last week

In the theater of your love I lost my part

"Cat’s in the Cradle Lyrics[Verse 1]
A child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talking before I knew it
And as he grew he'd say, I'm going to be like you dad
You know I'm going to be like you

He said, I'm going to be like him, yeah, you know I'm going to be like him

Well he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say

See you later can I have them please

I've long since retired my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, I'd like to see you if you don't mind

You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you dad
It's been sure nice talking to you

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me3Embed"
"Can’t Help but Wonder Where I’m Bound Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's a long and dusty road, a hot and a heavy load
And the folks I meet aren't always kind
Some are bad and some are good

And some have tried to ease my troubled mind

Trying to find what I was meant to do
And the people that I see look as worried as can be
And it looks like they are wondering too

Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound

And she loved me until my head went plumb insane
But I was too blind to see she was drifting away from me
And my good gal went off on the morning train

And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound

If you see me passing by and you sit and you wonder why

Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor, lace them up and bar the door

Around Nassau town we did roam

The first mate, he got drunk, broke up the people's trunk
Constable had to come and take him away

Then he took and ate up all of my corn
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home?
Well, this is the worst trip since I have been born

"Custer LyricsNow, I will tell you, buster, that I ain't a fan of Custer's
And the General, he don't ride well anymore
To some, he was a hero, but to me, his score was zero
And the General, he don't ride well anymore

Now, Custer done his fighting without too much exciting
And the General, he don't ride well anymore
General Custer come in pumping when the men were out a-hunting
But the General, he don't ride well anymore

With victories he was swimming: he killed children, dogs, and women
But the General, he don't ride well anymore
Crazy Horse sent out the call to Sitting Bull and Gall
And the General, he don't ride well anymore

Now, Custer split his men ― well, he won't do that again
'Cause the General, he don't ride well anymore
Twelve thousand warriors waited, they were unanticipated
And the General, he don't ride well anymore
It's not called an Indian victory but a bloody massacre
And the General, he don't ride well anymore
There might have been more enthusing if us Indians had been losing
But the General, he don't ride well anymore

General George A. Custer, oh, his yellow hair had luster
But the General, he don't ride well anymore
For now the General's silent, he got barbered violent
And the General, he can't ride well anymore
Oh, the General, he don't ride well anymore1Embed"

I was riding Number 9
Heading south from Caroline
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
I got in trouble, had to roam
I left my gal and left my home
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

[Chorus]
Just a kid, acting smart
I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off the Georgia Main
Locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
[Verse]
All alone I bear the shame
I'm a number, not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
All I do is sit and cry
When that evening train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I'll be locked here in this cell
Till my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that gal of mine
I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lonesome whistle blowEmbed"
"Mean Eyed Cat Lyrics[Verse 1]
I gave my woman half my money at the general store
I said, ""Now buy a little groceries and don't spend no more""
But she paid ten dollars for a ten-cent hat
And bought some store-bought cat food for that mean-eyed cat

[Verse 2]
When I woke up this morning and I turned my head
There wasn't a cotton-picking thing on her side of the bed
I found a little old note where her head belonged
It said, ""Dear John, honey, baby, I'm long gone""

[Verse 3]
When I heard a whistle blowing and the big wheels a-turning
I was scared as I could be
I put on my overalls and I headed for town
Gonna bring her back with me
[Verse 4]
I asked the man down at the station if he'd seen her there
I told him all about her pretty eyes and long blonde hair
He spit his tobacco and said, ""I'll be dad blamed""
""I believe I did see her leaving on the eastbound train""

[Verse 5]
I bought a round-trip ticket on the eastbound train
I was broke as I could be
But when I come back, I gotta buy another ticket
Gonna bring her back with me

[Verse 6]
Well, I got off the train somewhere in Arkansas
And I worked up the guts to call my mother-in-law
She said, ""I'll tell you where she is if you act right
She's working four-to-twelve at Trucker's World tonight""

[Verse 7]
Well, when I walked in, she saw me and she took off her apron
And she grabbed her going-home hat
She bought a ticket with her tips, now we're curled up on the sofa
Me and her and that mean-eyed catEmbed"

"The Frozen Logger LyricsAs I sat down one evening within a small cafe
A forty year old waitress to me these words did say:

""I see that you are a logger, and not just a common bum
'Cause nobody but a logger stirs his coffee with is thumb

My lover was a logger, there's none like him today;
If you'd pour whiskey on it he could eat a bale of hay

He never shaved his whiskers from off of his horny hide;
He'd just drive them in with a hammer and bite them off inside

My lover came to see me upon one freezing day;
He held me in his fond embrace which broke three vertebrae

He kissed me when we parted, so hard that he broke my jaw;
I could not speak to tell him he'd forgot his mackinaw
I saw my lover leaving, sauntering through the snow
Going gaily homeward at forty-eight below

The weather it tried to freeze him, it tried its level best;
At a hundred degrees below zero, he buttoned up his vest

It froze clean through to China, it froze to the stars above;
At a thousand degrees below zero, it froze my logger love

They tried in vain to thaw him, and would you believe me, sir
They made him into axeblades, to chop the Douglas fir

And so I lost my lover, and to this cafe I come
And here I wait till someone stirs his coffee with his thumb.""Embed"
"1 Corinthians 15:55 LyricsO Death, where is thy sting?
O Grave, where is thy victory?
O Life, you are a shining path
And hope springs eternal, just over the rise
When I see my redeemer beckoning me

Oh row my ship over the waves of your sea
Let me find a safe port now and then
Don't let the dark one in your sanctuary
Until it's time to pack it in

O, row, row my ship
With the fire of your breath
And don't lay a broadside on your ship as yet
Blow ye warm winds
When it's chilly and wet
And don't come to soon yet
For collecting my debt
O Death, where is thy sting?
O Grave, where is thy victory?
O Life, you are a shining path
And hope springs eternal, just over the rise
When I see my redeemer beckoning me

Oh let me sail on
With my ship to the East
And keep my eye on the North Star
When the journey is no good for man or for beast
I'll be safe wherever you are

Just let me sail into your harbor of lights
And there and forever to cast out my line
Give me my task
And let me do it right
And do it with all of my mightEmbed"
"As Long As the Grass Shall Grow Lyrics[Chorus]
As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow

[Verse]
The Senecas are an Indian tribe of the Iroquois nation
Down on the New York Pennsylvania Line you'll find their reservation
After the US revolution Cornplanter was a chief
He told the tribe these men they could trust that was his true belief
He went down to Independence Hall and there was a treaty signed
That promised peace with the USA and Indian rights combined
George Washington gave his signature the Government gave its hand
They said that now and forever more that this was Indian land

[Chorus]
As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow
[Verse]
On the Seneca reservation there is much sadness now
Washington's treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how
Across the Allegheny River they're throwing up a dam
It will flood the Indian country a proud day for Uncle Sam
It has broke the ancient treaty with a politician's grin
It will drown the Indians graveyards Cornplanter can you swim
The earth is mother to the Senecas they're trampling sacred ground
Change the mint green earth to black mud flats as honor hobbles down

[Chorus]
As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow

[Verse]
The Iroquois Indians used to rule from Canada way south
But no one fears the Indians now and smiles the liar's mouth
The Senecas hired an expert to figure another site
But the great good army engineers said that he had no right
Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way
They laughed in his face and said no deal Kinzua dam is here to stay
Congress turned the Indians down brushed off the Indians plea
So the Senecas have renamed the dam they call it Lake Perfidy

[Chorus]
As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow
[Verse]
Washington, Adams, and Kennedy now hear their pledges ring
The treaties are safe we'll keep our word but what is that gurgling
It's the back water from Perfidy Lake it's rising all the time
Over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine
No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy in winter it will fill
In summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill
But the Government of the USA has corrected George's vow
The father of our country must be wrong what's an Indian anyhow

[Outro]
As long as the moon shall rise [Look up]
As long as the rivers flow [Are you thirsty?]
As long as the sun will shine [My brother, are you warm?]

"The Ways Of A Woman In Love LyricsYou've cut out your dancing and you never see a show
Friends come by to pick you up and you hardly ever go
It seems your head is in the clouds above
You've got the ways of a woman in love

I walked by your house tonight and hoped that I might see
The guy who's got you in the spin I wish that guy was me
I don't know why it's you I'm dreaming of
You've got the ways of a woman in love

Many is the night I've stayed awake and cried
Now you'll never know how much you hurt my foolish pride
I recall your kisses the times I held you tight
Now when I come to see you you're sitting in the light
Missing all the things that we dreamed of
You've got the ways of a woman in love
[Outro]
Many is the night I've stayed awake and cried
You've got the ways of a woman in loveEmbed"
"Greystone Chapel Lyrics""Thank you very much. This next song was written by a man right here in Folsom Prison. And last night was the first time I ever sung this song. Anyway, this song was written by our friend Glenn Shirley, and... (applause) I hope I do your song justice, Glenn. We'll do our best...""

[Chorus]
Inside the walls of prison my body may be
But my Lord has set my soul free

[Verse 1]
There's a grey stone chapel here at Folsom
A house of worship in this den of sin
You wouldn't think that God had a place here at Folsom
But he saved the soul of many lost men
Now this grey stone chapel here at Folsom
Stands a hundred years old made of granite rock
It takes a ring of keys to move here at Folsom
But the door to the house of God is never locked
[Chorus]
Inside the walls of prison my body may be
But my Lord has set my soul free

[Verse 2]
There are men here that don't ever worship
There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray
But I've got down on my knees in that grey stone chapel
And I've thanked the Lord for helping me each day
Now this grey stone chapel here at Folsom
It has a touch of God's hand on every stone
It's a flower of light in a field of darkness
And it's given me the strength to carry on

[Chorus]
Inside the walls of prison my body may be
But my Lord has set my soul freeEmbed"
"Flesh and Blood Lyrics[Intro]
Flesh and blood

Beside a Singin Mountain Stream
Where the Willow grew
Where the Silver Leaf of Maple
Sparkled in the Morning Dew
I braided Twigs of Willows
Made a String of Buckeye Beads
But Flesh And Blood needs Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need

I leaned against a Bark of Birch
And I breathed the Honey Dew
I saw a North-bound Flock of Geese
Against a Sky of Baby Blue
Beside the Lily Pads
I carved a Whistle from a Reed
Mother Nature's quite a Lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood needs Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
A mockingbird sang just for me
And I thanked him for the Song
Then the Sun went slowly down the West
And I had to move along
These were some of the things
On which my Mind and Spirit feed
But Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need

And when this Day was ended
I was still not satisfied
I knew ev'rything I touched
Would wither and one day die
And Love was all that would remain
And grow from all these Seed;
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need4Embed"
"I’m on Fire LyricsHey, little girl, is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
I'm on fire

Tell me now, baby, is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I do
I can take you higher
I'm on fire

It's like someone took a knife, edgy and dull
Dug a six-inch valley In the middle of my skull

At night, I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
Freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
Hey, little girl, is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire

And tell me now, baby, is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I do
I can take you higher

"Lumberjack Lyrics[Intro]
Ride this train to Roseburg, Oregon, now there's a town for you
And you talk about rough
You know a lot of places in the country claim Paul Bunyon lived there
But you should have seen Roseburg when me and my daddy come there
Every one of them loggers looked like Paul Bunyon to me
And I was a skinny kid about sixteen
And I was scared to death when we walked into that camp
None of the lumberjacks paid any attention to me at first
But when my pa told the boss that me and him wanted a job
A lot of 'em stopped their work to see what was gonna happen
That big boss walked around me looked me up and down and said
Mister, I believe that boy is made out of second growth timber and I guess I was
Everybody but me and pa had a big laugh over it
Pa got kinda mad and the boss finally said he might start me out as a high climber
I didn't know what a high climber was, boy, I sure learned fast
That steel corded rope cut my back and that axe
I thought it was gonna break my arms off but I stuck with it
It wasn't long 'til I learned that a man's got to be a lot tougher than the timber he's cuttin'
Finally I could swing that crosscut saw with the best of them
[Verse 1]
I lived on a farm out in Iowa
I pulled the corn and I worked in the hay
Got trapped by a girl but I wiggled free
Heard the Oregon timber calling me

[Chorus]
Will you tell me something, Mr. Lumberjack?
Is it one for forward and three for back?
Is it two for stop or four for go?
Boy, ask a whistle punk, I don't know

[Verse 2]
Well, I learned this fact from a logger named Ray
You don't cut timber on a windy day
Stay out of the woods when the moisture's low
Or you ain't gonna live to collect your dough

[Chorus]
Will you tell me something, Mr. Lumberjack?
Is it one for forward and three for back?
Is it two for stop or four for go?
Boy, ask a whistle punk, I don't know

[Verse 3]
Well you work in the woods from morning to night
You laugh and sing and you cuss and fight
On Saturday night you go to Eugene
And on a Sunday morning, your pockets are clean
[Chorus]
Will you tell me something, Mr. Lumberjack?
Is it one for forward and three for back?
Is it two for stop or four for go?
Boy, ask a whistle punk, I don't knowEmbed"
"The Baron Lyrics[Chorus]
I wish I had of known you when you were a little younger, around me you might have learned a thing or two
If I'd known you longer you might be a little stronger
Maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do, maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do

[Verse 1]
As he walked into the poolroom you could tell he didn't fit
In his hand made boots, custom suit, pearl handled shooting stick
Tonight there'd be a showdown then everyone would know
Who shoots the meanest game around, The Baron or Billy Joe
Billy Joe looked edgy, about to lose his cool
But the Baron's hands were steady as the two began to duel
Yeah, he was like a General on a battlefield of slate
And he would say to Billy Joe each time he sunk the eight, he'd say

[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Now Billy Joe was busted but he hadn't felt the sting
And from the far end of the table he threw his Mother's wedding ring
And he said, You won my money but it isn't going to do the trick
I'll bet this ring on one more game against your fancy stick
The Baron's eyes grew foggy as the ring rolled on the felt
And he almost doubled over like he was hit below the belt
Twenty years ago it was the ring his wife had worn
And he didn't know before he left that a son would soon be born
It sounded just like thunder, when the Baron shot the break
But it grew quickly quiet as he lined up the eight
Then a warm hand touched his shoulder and it chilled him to the bone
When he turned and saw the woman who had loved him for so long
The game was never finished, the eight ball never fell
The Baron calmly picked it up and put it on the shelf
Then he placed the ring in the hand that held him long ago
And he tossed that fancy shooting stick to his son Billy Joe
And he said

"I Ride an Old Paint Lyrics[Chorus 1]
I ride an old paint, I lead an old dan
I'm going to Montana to throw the hoolihan
They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw
Their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw

[Chorus 2]
Ride around little dogies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are raring to go

Old Bill Jones had a daughter and a son
One went to college, the other went wrong
His wife, she got killed in a poolroom fight
But still he's a-singing from morning  untill night

When I die, take my saddle from the wall
Place it on my old pony, lead him out of his stall
Tie my bones to my saddle and turn our faces to the West
And we'll ride the prairie we love the best

On a Tuesday, they locked me in the jail (oh boy)
On a Wednesday, my trial was attested
On a Thursday, they said guilty and the Judge's gavel fell

I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
I got chains, chains around my feet
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains
They're about to drag me down

On a Monday, my momma come to see me
On a Tuesday, they caught me with a file
On a Wednesday, I'm down in solitary
On a Thursday, I start on bread and water for a while
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
I got chains, chains around my feet
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains
They're about to drag me down

I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders

"Tennessee Lyrics[Verse 1]
Momma I guess you heard
I got married in Tennessee
I got a blue eyed girl
Who thinks the world of me

We got a cabin in the country
And a creek that rolls near by
And a dog that won't even bark at a firefly

Our clothes lines hang just outside our back door
And theres a tire that swings in the air 10 feet or more
Theres a church I can't seem to find on Sunday morning
But I sure found the place I belong in

[Chorus]
And we wear blue jeans and big green things
Spend the summer time naturally high
By, chopping wood for next winters fire
Saving our money for the county fair
George Jones is supposed to be there
We got, forty acres of corn on the ground
Tennessee taters we sell by the pound
Proud as we can be, to live in Tennessee
[Verse 2]
Momma you and Dad gotta come stay with us sometime
I know you'll love that sweet little gal of mine
You and her could take about babies
Make some homemade apple pie
While me and Dad take a walk maybe talk about old times

And we wear blue jeans and big green things
Spend the summer time naturally high
By, chopping wood for next winters fire
Saving our money for the county fair

Proud as we can be, to live in Tennessee

We are proud as we can be to be from Tennesse

I've been unwise
Restless from the cradle

It's so hard to see the rainbow
Through glasses dark as these
Maybe I'll be able

Oh, I am weak
Oh, I know I am vain
Take this weight from me
Let my spirit be unchained

Seems that we've both forgotten
Forgotten to go home
Oh, have I seen an angel?
Oh, have I seen a ghost?
Where's that rock of ages
When I need it most?

Oh, I am weak
Oh, I know I am vain

"Sixteen tons Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bone
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said ""Well, a-bless my soul""

You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning, it was drizzling rain
Fighting and trouble are my middle name
Raised in the canebrake by an old mama lion
Can't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line

You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

If you see me coming, better step aside
A lot of men didn't and a lot of men died
The one fist of iron and the other of steel
If the right one don't a-get you

Another day older and deeper in debt

"So Doggone Lonesome Lyrics[Verse 1]
I do my best to hide this lowdown feeling
I try to make believe there's nothing wrong
But they're always asking me about you darling
And it hurts me so to tell them that you're gone

[Verse 2]
If they ask me, I guess, I'd be denying
That I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it crying:
""Where's my darling, when's she coming home?""

[Chorus 1]
I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
Well I make it pretty good until that moon comes shining through
And that I get so doggone lonesome
[Verse 3]
Time stands still when you're awaiting
Sometimes I think my heart is stopping too
One lonely hour seems forever
Sixty minutes more to wait for you

[Verse 4]
But I guess I'll keep waiting till you're with me
Cause I believe that loving you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow
If I can't have you with me tonight

[Chorus 2]
Well I know, I'll keep on loving you cause true love can't be killed
I ought to get you off of my mind but I guess I never will
I could have a dozen others but I know, I'd love you still

After seven years behind these bars together
I'll miss you more than a brother when you go. when you go
If only I had not tried to escape
They'd barred me with you, I know, yes I know

Won't you tell the folks back home I'll soon be coming
And don't let them know I never will be free, be free
Sometimes write and tell me how they're doing
And send a picture of mother back to me

Say hello to dad and shake his poor hardworking hand
And send a picture of mother if you can

I'm happy for you that you got your freedom
But stay with me just another minute or so, or so
After all this sweating blood together
Who'll be my fighting partner when you go, when you go
The hardest time will be on Sunday morning
Church bells will ring on Heaven Hill, Heaven Hill
Please ask Reverend Garrett to pray for me
And send a picture of mother if you will

He turned the water into wine he turned the water into wine
In the little Cana town the word went all around that he turned the water into wine
Well he walked upon the Sea of Galilee he walked upon the Sea of Galilee
Shouted far and wide he calmed the raging tide and walked upon the Sea of Galilee
He turned the water into wine
He healed the leper and the lame he healed the leper and the lame
He said go and tell no man but they shouted it through the land

With a little bit of fish and bread they said everyone was fed

"I Walk the Line (Revisited) Lyrics[Verse 1: Rodney Crowell]
I'm back on board that '49 Ford in 1956
Long before the sun came up, way out in the sticks
The headlight showed a two rut roadway
Back up in the pines
First time I heard Johnny Cash sing I Walk The Line

[Verse 2: Rodney Crowell]
I got my thrill behind the wheel upon my daddy's lap
Grandpa rode co-pilot with a flashlight and a map
Cane pole out the window, it was in the summertime
First time I heard Johnny Cash sing I Walk The Line
[Hook 1: Johnny Cash]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
[Verse 3: Rodney Crowell]
I never will forget that day, I know the time and place
It sounded like the whole thing came right down from outer space
I still can see those headlights and that dashboard in my mind
The first time I heard Johnny Cash sing I Walk The Line
[Hook 2: Johnny Cash]
I find it very very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
[Guitar Solo: Johnny Cash]
Ah, skinny pack
(Mmmmmmmmmmm)

[Verse 4: Rodney Crowell]
All these long years later it's still music to my ears
I swear it sounds as good right now as anything I hear
I've seen the Mona Lisa, I've heard Shakespeare read real fine
Just like hearing Johnny Cash sing I Walk The Line

[Hook 3: Johnny Cash]
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

Because you're mine, I walk the line1Embed"
"Banks of the Ohio LyricsI asked my love to take a walk
Take a walk, just a little ways
And as we walked and we would talk
How it would be our weddingday

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

I asked her if she'd marry me
And my wife forever be
She only turned her head away
And had no other words to say

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio
I plunged a knife into her breast
And told her she was going to rest
She cried ""Oh Willy, don't murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity.""

I took her by her golden curls
And drug her down to the river-side
An there I threw her into drown
And I watched her as she floated down

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

And going home between twelve and one
I cried ""Oh Lord, what have I've done?""
I've killed the only girl I love
Because she would not marry me

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the OhioEmbed"

And if I have been unkind
I just hope that you will let it go by
And if I have been untrue

Like a baby stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me
But I swear by this song
By all that I have done wrong
I'll make it all up to thee
I saw a young man leaning on his wooden crutch
He called out to me, ""Don't ask for so much""
And a young woman leaning in her darkened door
She cried out to me, ""Why not ask for more?""

Hidden memories come stealing from my mind
And I feel my own heart beating out the simple joy of living
And I wonder how I ever was that kind

But the wild road I was rambling was always out there calling
And you said a hundred times I should have died
Then you reached down and touched me and lifted me up with you
So I believe it was a road I was meant to ride

I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
I don't have to do that anymore
I'm like a soldier getting over the war
There are nights I don't remember and pain that's been forgotten
And a lot of things I choose not to recall
There are faces that come to me in my darkest secret memories
Faces that I wish would not come back at all

But in my dream's parade of lovers from the other times and places
There's not one that matters now, no matter who
I'm just thankful for the journey and that I've survived the battles
And that my spoils of victory is you

Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways

"The Cremation of Sam McGee LyricsThere's strange things done in the midnight sun
By the men that toil for gold;
The Arctic trails have their secret tales
That would make your blood run cold;
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights
But the queerest they ever did see
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge that
I cremated Sam McGee

Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows
Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows
He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;
Though he'd often say in his homely way that ""he'd sooner live in hell.""

On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail
You talk of your cold! Through the parkas fold it stabbed like a driven nail
If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;
It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee
And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow
And the dogs were fed, and the stars overhead were dancing heel and toe
He turned to me, and ""Cap,"" says he, ""I'll cash in this trip, I guess;
And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request.""

Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of moan:
""It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled clean through to the bone
Yet it ain't being dead—it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;
So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains.""

Well, a pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;
And we started on at the break of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale
And he crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee;
And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee

With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, I hurried, horror-driven
There wasn't a breath in that land of death, because of a promise given; It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say: ""You may tax your brawn and brains
But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate my last remains.""

Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code
In the days to come, though my lips were numb, in my heart how I cursed that load
In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies, round in a ring
Howled out their woes to the homeless snows— O God! how I loathed that thing

And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;
And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;
And the trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give in;
And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin
Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;
It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a thrice it was called the ""Alice May.""
And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;
Then ""Here,"" said I, with a sudden cry, ""is my crematorium.""

Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;
Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;
The flames just soared, and the furnace roared—such a blaze you never did see;
And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee

Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;
And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow
It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I don't know why;
And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky

I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;
But the stars came out and they danced about before again I ventured near;
I was sick with dread, but I bravely said: ""I'll just take a peek inside
I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked""; ... then the door I opened wide

And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;
And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: ""Please close that door
It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm—
And since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, this is the first time I've been warm.""

There's strange things done in the midnight sun
By the men who toil for gold;
The Arctic trails have their secret tales
That would make your blood run cold;
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights
But the queerest they ever did see
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge that
I cremated Sam McGeeEmbed"
"Oh, Bury Me Not Lyrics[Verse]
Lord, I've never lived where churches grow
I loved creation better as it stood
That day you finished it so long ago
And looked upon your work and called it good
I know that others find you in the light
That sifted down through tinted window panes
And yet I seem to feel you near tonight
In this dim, quiet starlight on the plains
I thank you, Lord, that I'm placed so well
That you've made my freedom so complete
That I'm no slave to whistle, clock or bell
Nor weak eyed prisoner of Waller Street
Just let me live my life as I've begun
And give me work that's open to the sky
Make me a partner of the wind and sun
And I won't ask a life that's soft or high
Let me be easy on the man that's down
Let me be square and generous with all
I'm careless sometimes, Lord, when I'm in town
But never let them say I'm mean or small
Make me as big and open as the plains
And honest as the horse between my knees
Clean as a wind that blows behind the rains
Free as the hawk that circles down the breeze
Forgive me, Lord, if sometimes I forget
You know about the reasons that are hid
You understand the things that gall or fret
Well, you knew me better than my mother did
Just keep an eye on all that's done and said
And right me sometimes when I turn aside
And guide me on that long, dim trail ahead
That stretches upward toward the great divide
[Bridge]
Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie
These words came low and mournfully
From the pallid lips of a youth who lay
On his dying bed at the close of day

[Outro]
Oh, bury me not and his voice failed there
But we took no heed to his dying prayer
In a shallow grave just six by three
We buried him there on the lone prairieEmbed"
"I Saw the Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my Dear Savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light

[Chorus]
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

[Verse 2]
Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord - I saw the light
[Chorus]
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

[Verse 3]
I was a fool to wander and stray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

[Chorus]
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the lightEmbed"

"Were You There (When They Crucified My Lord) Lyrics[Verse]
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
Oh were you there when they crucified my Lord?
(Ohh, sometimes it causes me to tremble)
Tremble
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
Were you there when they nailed Him to the cross?
Were you there when they nailed Him to the cross?
(Ohh, sometimes it causes me to tremble)

Were you there when they nailed Him to the cross?
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?

Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
Well, were you there when the stone was rolled away?
Were you there when the stone was rolled away?

"Foolish Questions LyricsNow you've all heard foolish questions and no doubt you've wondered why
Some person will ask a foolish question and expect a sensible reply
Like when you take your girl some candy, say maybe just after tea
You notice how she'll grab it and then she'll say, ""Is this for me?""

Foolish Questions! You can answer when you can
""No I bought this candy for your Ma or Pa, or for John the hired hand
""I just thought you'd like to see it. Now I'm gonna take it away""
Now wasn't that a foolish question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day

And then most every morning, there is someone 'round the place
Who sees you take the shaving brush and lather up your face
And as you give the razor a preliminary wave
This fool will walk up and ask you, ""Are you gonna take a shave?""

Foolish questions! Your answer is, I hope
""No! I ain't prepared for shavin', I just like the taste of soap!
I kinda like to take the shaving brush and paint myself this way""
Now wasn't that a foolish question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day!
Now then there's this fella who meets you on your way
And asks you why your all dressed up and listens while you say
That you just been returning from the funeral of poor old Uncle Ned
As soon as you have told him, he will say, ""Is Ned dead?""

Foolish questions! You might as well reply
""No, he thought he'd have the funeral now. Then later on he'd die
You know Ned was always so original, he wanted it that way""
Now wasn't that a Foolish Question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day!

Now suppose the elevator guy should forget to close the door
And you should tumble down, oh say forty-seven floors
And when you reach the bottom and you're lying there inert
Some fool will stick his head down the shaft and holler, ""Are you hurt?""

Foolish Questions! Your dying words are
""No! I was in an awful hurry and that elevator's just too slow
Usually saves a lot of time, you know, comin' down this way""
Now wasn't that a Foolish Question? You'll hear 'em ev'ry day!

That was a Foolish Question! You'll hear 'em ev'ry day!Embed"
"Rose of My Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're the best partners this world's ever seen
Together as close as can be
But sometimes it's hard to find time in between
To tell you what you mean to me

[Chorus]
You are the rose of my heart
You are the love of my life
A flower not fading nor falling apart
If you're tired, rest your head on my arm
Rose of my heart

[Verse 2]
When sorrow holds you in its arms of clay
It's rain drops that fall from your eyes
Your smile is like the sun come to earth for a day
You brighten my blackest of skies

[Verse 3]
So hard times or easy times, what do I care
There's nothing I'd change if I could
The tears and the laughter are things that we share
Your hand in mine makes it good

"Redemption Song LyricsOld pirates, yes, they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ship
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit

But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty

None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy

"In the Sweet By-and-By LyricsThere's a land that is fairer than day
And by faith we can see it apart
For the father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there
In the sweet bye and bye
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet bye and bye
We shall meet on that beautiful shore

We shall sing on that beautiful shore
For the melodious songs of the blessed
And our spirits shall sorrow no more
Not a sight for the blessing of rest
In the sweet bye and bye
To a bountiful father above
We shall offer our tribute of praise
For the glory as gift of his love
And the blessings that hallow our days
In the sweet by and bye
In the sweet by and byeEmbed"
"Green, Green Grass of Home Lyrics[Verse 1]
The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and my papa
Down the road I look, and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Verse 2]
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
[Chorus]
Yes, they'll all come to see me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Verse 3]
Then I awake and look around me
To the cold gray walls that surround me
And then I realize I was only dreaming
For there's a guard, and a sad old padre
Arm in arm, I walk at daybreak
Again, I'll touch the green, green grass of home

[Chorus]
Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of the old tree as they lay me
'Neath the green, green grass of home

[Spoken Outro]
Thank you very much
This next song was written by a man right here in Folsom Prison
And last night was the first time I've ever sung the song
Anyway, this song was written by our friend Glenn Shirley, and–
Um, hope we do your song justice, man

If I hadn't of shot poor Delia

Shot her in the side

"The Gambler Lyrics[Verse 1]
About twenty years ago on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with The Gambler we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns staring through the window at the darkness
Until boredom overtook us and he commenced to speak
He said, Son, I've made a life out of reading people's faces
And knowing what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
And if you don't mind my saying I would say you're out of aces
And for one taste of your whiskey I will give you some advice
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette then he bummed a light
The night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
He said, If you're going to play the game, boy, you better learn to play it right
Because every gambler knows that the secret to survival
Is knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep
And every hand's a winner just like every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep
[Chorus]
You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them
Know when to walk away, know when to run
You don't ever count your money while you're sitting at the table
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealing is done
You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them
Know when to walk away, know when to run
You don't ever count your money while you're sitting at the table
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealing is done

[Verse 2]
And when he finished speaking
He turned back toward the window
Put out his cigarette
Faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The gambler, he broke even
But in his final words
I found an ace that I could keep

[Chorus]
You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them
Know when to walk away, know when to run
You don't ever count your money while you're sitting at the table
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealing is done
You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them
Know when to walk away, know when to run
You don't ever count your money while you're sitting at the table
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealing is done
You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them
Know when to walk away, know when to run
You don't ever count your money while you're sitting at the table
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealing is done2Embed"
"Girl from the North Country LyricsIf you're travelin' the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

If you go when snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds

Please see if her hair hangs long
It rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair's hangin' long
For that's the way I remember her best

I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my of my day
So if you're travelin' the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine1Embed"
"Suppertime Lyrics[Verse 1]
Many years ago in days of childhood I used to play until evening time would come
Then winding down an old familiar pathway I hear my mother call at setting sun

[Chorus]
Come home, come home it's suppertime
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's suppertime
We're going home at last

Some of the fondest memories of my childhood are woven around suppertime. When mother used to call from the back steps of the old homeplace, ""Come on home now son, it's suppertime."" My how I'd love to hear that once again. But you know time has woven for me a realization of a truth that's even more thrilling. That soon we'll be called together around the great supper table up there for the greatest suppertime of them all with our Lord. I can almost hear the call now coming through the portals of heaven, ""Come home son, it's suppertime. Come on home.""

[Chorus]
Come home, come home it's suppertime
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's suppertime
We're going home at last
[Verse 2]
Through the distant clouds I see my mother
Her face is shining bright, with tender love
She's gone up in heaven, with her maker
And I can still hear her voice, from up above
(and she said)

[Chorus]
Come home, come home it's suppertime
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's suppertime
We're going home at lastEmbed"

Oh, lord, help me walk
Another mile, just one more mile;

And lord, help me to smile
Another smile, just one more smile;
Don't think I can do things on my own

I never thought I needed help before;
Thought that I could get by - by myself
But now I know I just can't take it any more
And with a humble heart, on bended knee
I'm begging You please for help

Oh come down from Your golden throne to me, to lowly me;

"I Drove Her out of My Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]
She gave me my walking papers
And ran off with someone new
Cuz he bought her things
My wages couldn't buy
So I turned to ups and downers
And everything between
Still I can't get her good lovin'
Off my mind

Well today I bought a Cadillac
The kind she's always wanted
I called and asked her
If she'd like to ride
She said this is our last date
I said that's alright with me
Cause tonight I'm driving her
Out of my mind

Yeah I'll take her on a scenic cruise
Right off of Lookout Mountain
Cause she said I never took her out
When she was mine
She'll see all seven states
As we drive to the pearly gates
Tonight when I drive her
Out of my mind

[Verse 2]
All the papers will read ""Lovers leap
Again off Lookout Mountain""
Cause i wrote a note
That called it suicide
But my epitaph will say
He killed his pain yesterday
When he finally drove that woman
Off his mind

Well now here she comes to greet me
Dressed to kill and so am I
Hope she asks me if this
Cadillac will fly
And I know that I'll die laughin'
When I show her that it will
When I drive that woman
Right out of my mind

Yeah I'll take her on a scenic cruise
Right off of Lookout Mountain
Cause she said I never took her out

"I Came to Believe Lyrics[Verse 1]
I couldn't manage the problems I laid on myself
And it just made it worse when I laid them on somebody else
So I finally surrendered it all brought down in despair
I cried out for help and I felt a warm comforter there

And I came to believe in a power much higher than I
I came to believe that I needed help to get by
In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I

Nothing worked out when I handled it all on my own
And each time I failed it made me feel twice as alone
Then I cried, ""Lord there must be a sure and easier way
For it just cannot be that a man should lose hope every day.""

My bills are all due and the babies need shoes
But I'm Busted
Cotton's gone down to a quarter a pound
And I'm Busted
I got a cow that's gone dry
And a hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills
Getting bigger each day
The county's going to haul my belongings away
But I'm Busted
So I called on my brother to ask for a loan
Because I was Busted
I hate to beg like a dog for a bone
But I'm Busted
My brother said, ""there's not a thing I can do
My wife and my kids
Are all down with the flu
And I was just thinking about calling on you
Because I'm Busted
Lord, I am not no thief, but a man can go wrong
When he's Busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone
But I'm Busted
Now the fields are all bare
And the cotton won't grow
Me and my family's got to pack up and go
But I'll make a living, just where, I don't know
Because I'm BustedEmbed"

Hoof prints and foot prints, deep ruts the wagons made
The victor and the loser came by here
No head stones, but these bones bring the mascalero death moans
See the smooth black nuggets by the thousands lying here
Petrified, but justified are these apache tears
Dead grass, dry roots, hunger crying in the night
Ghost of broken hearts and laws are here
And who saw the young squaw, they judged by their whiskey law
Tortured till she died of pain and fear
Where the soldiers lay her back, are the black apache tears
The young men, the old men, the guilty and the innocent
Bled red blood and chilled alike with fears
The red men, the white men, no fight ever took this land
So don't raise the dust when you pass here
They're sleeping and in my keeping are these apache tears1Embed"
"The Fourth Man in the Fire LyricsThey wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knees to Idols made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the Fourth Man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn

Now the prophet Daniel tells about
Three men who walked with God
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Before the wicked king they stood
And the king commanded them bound and thrown
Into the fiery furnace that day
But the fire was so hot that the men were slain
That forced them on their way
Now when the three were cast in and the king rose up
To witness this awful fate
He began to tremble at what he saw
In astonished tones he spake
Did we not cast three men bound
Into the midst of the fire
Well, Lo, I see four men unhurt
Unbound and walkin' down there;

There's Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
And the fiery coals they trod
But the form of the Fourth Man that I see
Is like the Son of God;Embed"
"A Wednesday Car Lyrics[Verse]
The assembly line is running slow on Monday
They've been living it up and laying up Saturday and Sunday
On Tuesday they're about to come around
But they still feel bad and they're kinda down
And mad cause they've got four more days before the weekend rolls around
On Wednesday they're feeling fine again
And they're working like a dog and digging in
Trying to do everything they should putting the cars together good
And I got myself a car that was made on Wednesday, on Wednesday
If you're going to buy yourself a new car
You just better hope you're lucky enough to get one made on Wednesday
On Thursday the weekend is in sight
And they're in a hurry and they don't do nothing right
Friday is the worst day of the week, that's the day they make lemon dogs and freaks
If your car was made on Friday, friend, you'll soon be in the creek
Because it's payday and the loafing has begun
Lord, them Friday cars just hope you don't get one
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday
Are all bad days and the only try day is Wednesday
And my car was made on Wednesday, on Wednesday
If your car wasn't made on Wednesday, I'd advise you not to even leave home anyEmbed"
"Train of Love Lyrics[Chorus]
Train of love's a-coming, big black wheels a-humming
People waiting at the station, happy hearts are drumming
Trainman tell me maybe, ain't you got my baby
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

[Verse 1]
Now stop your whistle blowing, because I got ways of knowing
Your bringing other people's lovers, but my own keeps going
Train of love's deceiving, when she's not gone she's leaving
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
Train of love's now hasting, sweethearts standing waiting
Here and there and everywhere, they're going to be embracing
Trainman tell me maybe, ain't you got my baby
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
[Chorus]
Train of love's a-leaving, leaving my heart grieving
But early or late, I sit and wait, because I'm still believing
We'll walk away together, though I may wait forever
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home1Embed"
"Beans For Breakfast Lyrics[Verse]
I couldn't hear you for the TV, I didn't know you said goodbye
I saw your cancelled check for the airfare, didn't know flying got too high
Beans for breakfast once again, hard to eat them from the can
I've run out of clean utensils, I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man
I heard the crows outside my window, guess it's me they are talking about
The fire you lit has burnt to cinders, every good things fizzled out
Beans for breakfast once again, hard to eat 'em from the can
Wish you'd come back and wash the dishes, I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man
Caught a cold with the window open, crow droppings o my window sill
Probably got histoplasmosis, got no gun or I would kill them crows
Beans for breakfast once again, hard to eat them from the can
Plastic forks are a dime a dozen I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man
Finally made it to the mailbox, felt so bad I thought I'd die
All I got was a bill from my doctor, well I guess flying isn't so high
Bean for breakfast once again, hard to eat 'em from the can
Blue tick mattress cold and greasy, I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man
The house burned down from the fire that I built, in your closet by mistake
After I took all them pills, but I got out safe in my duck head overalls
Beans for breakfast once again, I'm a hungry nasty lonesome manEmbed"
"Song of the Patriot Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm a flag waving patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man
I love mom and apple pie and the freedoms that we all enjoy
Across this beautiful land
I worked hard and I fight hard for the old red, white and blue
And Ill die a whole lot harder if it comes to where I have to
I'm a flag waving patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I see old glory waving
I think of all the brave men
Who have fought and died for what is right and wrong

[Chorus]
And when I see old glory burning
My blood begins to churning
And I could do some fighting of my own
[Verse 2]
I don't believe in violence, I'm a God fearing man
But Id stand up for my country just as long as I can stand
Because I'm a flag waving patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man
I'm a flag waving patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man
And I enjoy the liberty of being what I want to be
And achieved in many goals that I can
I was taught to turn the other cheek, but Teddy used to say
Walk soft and pack a big stick, but never walk away
I'm a flag waving patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I see old glory waving
I think of all the brave men
Who had fought and died for what is right and wrong

[Chorus]
And when I see old glory burning
My blood begins to churning
And I could do some fighting of my own

[Verse 3]
Because I love all my brothers and we're proud of our group
We've got the greenest country here on Gods green earth
And I'm a flag waving patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee manEmbed"
"The Old Rugged Cross Lyrics[Verse 1]
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

[Chorus]
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
Until my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
And exchange it some day for a crown

[Verse 2]
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true
Its shame and reproach gladly bear
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away
Where His glory forever I'll share
[Chorus]
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
Until my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
And exchange it some day for a crown
And exchange it some day for a crown2Embed"
"I’m Movin’ On LyricsThat big eight-wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
I'm movin' on, I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high, for my little old sky
And I'm movin' on

That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the southland, we're comin' to you
I'm movin' on, oh, hear my song
You had the laugh on me, now I'm settin' you free
So keep movin' on

Mister fireman, won't you please listen to me
Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
Keep movin' on
Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler the fastest in the southern land
It keeps movin' me on, it keeps going on
You gonna ease my mind and put me there on time
And keep rollin' on

I've told you baby, from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You've broken your vow and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on

You've switched your engine now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
So I'm movin' on, you done your daddy wrong
I warned you twice, now you can settle the price
But I'm movin' on

But someday baby, when you've had your play
You want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on, you stayed away too long
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
Keep movin' onEmbed"
"When the Roll Is Called up Yonder Lyrics[Verse 1]
When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
When the saved diverse shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there

When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there

"Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie (And a Cowboy’s Prayer) Lyrics[Spoken: A Cowboy's Prayer]
Lord, I've never lived where churches grow
I loved creation better as it stood
That day you finished it so long ago
And looked upon your work and called it good

I know that others find you in the light
That sifted down through tinted window panes
And yet I seem to feel you near tonight
In this dim, quiet starlight on the plains

I thank you, Lord, that I'm placed so well
That you've made my freedom so complete
That I'm no slave to whistle, clock or bell
Nor weak-eyed prisoner of Waller Street
Just let me live my life as I've begun
And give me work that's open to the sky
Make me a partner of the wind and sun
And I won't ask a life that's soft or high

Let me be easy on the man that's down
Let me be square and generous with all
I'm careless sometimes, Lord, when I'm in town
But never let them say I'm mean or smal

Make me as big and open as the plains
And honest as the horse between my knees
Clean as a wind that blows behind the rains
Free as the hawk that circles down the breeze

Forgive me, Lord, if sometimes I forget
You know about the reasons that are hid
You understand the things that gall or fret
Well, you knew me better than my mother did

Just keep an eye on all that's done or said
And right me sometimes when I turn aside
And guide me on that long, dim trail ahead
That stretched upward toward the great divide

[Chorus]
""Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie""
These words came low and mournfully
From the pallid lips of a youth who lay
On his dying bed at the close of day
""Oh, bury me not..."" - and his voice failed there
But we took no heed to his dying prayer
In a shallow grave, just six by three
We buried him there on the lone prairieEmbed"
"You’re the Nearest Thing to Heaven Lyrics[Verse 1]
I have sailed the peaceful waters of the ocean deep and blue
I held my breath and watched the western sunsets golden hue
I've flown above the mountain peaks and valleys wide and green
But you're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
You're the nearest thing to heaven yes you are
I have searched for happiness so long and far
But my search for love was through the day that I found you
Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven yes you are
I confess that I've been tempted by alluring magic charms
When the smile was flashed my way and stood before two open arms
But I turned and walked away because I love you like I do
You're the nearest thing to heaven darling you

[Chorus]
You're the nearest thing to heaven
[Verse 2]
I have watched the silver raindrops fall to earth to cool the day
Watched the rainbow at twilight when the clouds had blown away
I love the pretty flowers but they cannot buy the worth
But you're the nearest thing to heaven on this earth

"Highwayman LyricsI was a highway man along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive
I was a sailor, I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still
I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around, I'll always be around
And around and around and around and around
I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again
And again and again and again and again2Embed"
"Singin’ in Vietnam Talkin’ Blues Lyrics[Verse]
One morning at breakfast, I said to my wife
We been everywhere once and some places twice
As I had another helping of country ham
She said ""We ain't never been to Vietnam
And there's a bunch of our boys over there
So we went to the Orient: Saigon
Well we got a big welcome when we drove in
Through the gates of a place that they call Long Vinh
We checked in and everything got kinda quiet
But a soldier boy said: ""Just wait until tonight
Things get noisy. Things start happening
Big bad firecrackers
Well that night we did about four shows for the boys
And they were living it up with a whole lot of noise
We did our last song for the night
And we crawled into bed for some peace and quiet
But things weren't peaceful. And things weren't quiet
Things were scary
Well for a few minutes June never said one word
And I thought at first that she hadn't heard
Then a shell exploded not two miles away
She sat up in bed and I heard her say: ""What was that?
I said: That was a shell, or a bomb
She said: I'm scared.I said ""Me too
Well all night long that noise kept on
And the sound would chill you right to the bone
The bullets and the bombs, and the mortar shells
Shook our bed every time one fell
And it never let up; it was gonna get worse
Before it got any better
Well when the sun came up, the noise died down
We got a few minutes sleep, an' we were sleeping sound
When a soldier knocked on our door and said
Last night they brought in seven dead, and 14 wounded
And would we come down to the base hospital, and see the boys
Yes
So we went to the hospital ward by day
And every night we were singing away
Then the shells and the bombs was going again
And the helicopters brought in the wounded men
Night after night; day after day
Coming and a going
So we sadly sang for them our last song
And reluctantly we said: So long
We did our best to let them know that we care
For every last one of them that's over there
Whether we belong over there or not
Somebody over here love's them, and needs them
Well now that's about all that there is to tell
About that little trip into living hell
And if I ever go back over there any more
I hope there's none of our boys there for me to sing for
I hope that war is over with
And they all come back home
To stay

In peaceEmbed"
"Doin’ My Time Lyrics[Verse]
On this old rock pile with a ball and chain
They call me by a number, not a name Lord, Lord
Got to do my time, I got to do my time
With an aching heart on that gal of mine

You can hear my hammer, you can hear my saw
Gonna swing it like John Henry all day long Lord, Lord
Got to do my time, I got to do my time
With an aching heart on that gal of mine

When that old judge looked down at me
Said I put you in that penitentiary Lord, Lord
Got to do my time, I got to do my time
With an aching heart on that gal of mine
Well now it won't be long just a few more days
They'll let me out of here I'm gonna stay Lord, Lord
With that gal of mine, with that gal of mine
She's waited for me while I've done my timeEmbed"
"The Pine Tree Lyrics[Verse]
I lean my back against you thinking you were an oak
I knew the wind could bent you but I can't believe you broke
Now the wind could never break me only your false love
Honey I've been true I swear by God above
I thought you were a willow but you never wept for me
You went roaming in the wildwood like a ship that roams the see
The willow tree is fickle and it weeps in the morning dew
My love is a pine tree cause that's the only tree that's true
If I was mistaken then take my eyes away
You made a bed in the wildwood and that's where I saw you lay
Honey your eyes deceived you it's true I touched the ground
But I never slept there I never let my long hair down mhm
Love is like a thorn bush touch it and you will find
You'll prick your fingers and leave the sweetest flower behind
Love oh love oh what you done to me
You set me a drifting like a ship upon the sea
Yes a ship there is I see you and you belong to me
My love is the ocean and deeper love cannot be
Yeah well I guess I was mistaken and woman I want you back
You never have left my heart now honey baby that's a fact
Come to me pine tree and we will never part
We'll put our roots down in each other's heart
Come to me pine treeEmbed"
"God Bless Robert E.Lee Lyrics[Verse]
When Robert E Lee surrended the Confederacy
Jefferson Davis was upset about it
He said how dare that man resent an order
Form the president of the Confederate States of America
Then somebody told him that General Lee had made the decision himself
In order to save lives because he felt that the battle coming up
Would cost about 20 000 lives on both sides
And he said 240 000 dead already is enough
So this song is not about the North or the South but about the bloody brother war
Brother against brother father against son the war that nobody won
And for all those lives that were saved I gotta say God bless Robert E Lee
Well the mansion where the General used to live is burning down
Cottonfields are blue with Sherman's troups
I overheard a yankee say yesterday Nashville fell
So I'm on my way to join the fight General Lee might need my help
But look away look away Dixie I don't want them to see
What they're doing to my Dixie God bless Robert E Lee
Sherman's troups burned Atlanta and the flames lit up the sky
And those of us who survived it are watching my Dixie die
But today at Appamattox General Lee sat down
And surrended to the yankees and Ulysees S Grant
So look away look away Dixie
[Outro]
I won't ever stop loving you my Dixie till they put me in the ground
And the last words they probably hear from me are God bless Robert E LeeEmbed"

I will miss you when you go much more than you'll ever know
But I'll have a memory to keep you near
In my heart, you will remain, but it just won't be the same
I will miss a million things that make you dear

Your lovely ways make you so sweet
I prayed the angels fair will keep your happiness
So you'll be blessed just as you deserve to be
I wonder why there are so few lovely people like you

"If I Give My Soul Lyrics(Get off stage, Cash. OK?)

Down a dangerous road, I have come to where I'm standing
With a heavy heart and my hat clutched in my hand
Such a foolish man, God ain't known no greater sinner
I have come in search of Jesus, hoping He will understand

If I give my soul, will He clean these clothes I'm wearin?
If I give my soul, will He put new boots on my feet?
If I bow my head and beg God for His forgiveness
Will He breathe new life within me and bring her back to me?

I had a woman once, she was kind and she was gentle
Had a child by me, who grew up to be a man
I had a steady job, 'til I started into drinking
Then I started making music travelin' with the devil's band
Oh the years went by like a mighty rush of eagles
Our dreams and plans were all scattered in the wind
And it's a lonesome life, when you lose the ones you live for
If I make my peace with Jesus will they take me back again?

If I give my soul, will he stop my hands from shaking?
If I give my soul, will my son love me again?
If I give my soul, and she knows i really mean it?
If I give my soul to Jesus will she take me back again?

If I give my soul, will He clean these clothes I'm wearin?
If I give my soul, will He put new boots on my feet?
If I bow my head and beg God for His forgiveness
Will He breathe new breath within me and bring her back to me?Embed"
"You’ll Never Walk Alone LyricsWhen you walk through a storm
Keep your chin up high
And don't be afraid of the dark

When you walk through a storm
Keep your chin up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
Is a golden sky
And the sweet, silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk aloneEmbed"
"Tear Stained Letter Lyrics[Verse]
I'm going to write a tear stained letter
I'm going to mail it straight to you
I'm going to bring back to your mind
What you said about always being true
About our secret hiding places
Being daily satisfied
I can see you sitting and reading it
While you hang, you head and cry
I just hope you're not so sad
You're going to go down suicide
I'm going to write a tear stained letter
Put it special delivery
Because it's gonna be full of stuff
That's only known to you and me
About how every time I get turned on
You turn me off and bring me down
It'll be about the darkest news
That ever did arrive in your hometown
It'll be about the saddest thing
Your mailman ever did bring around
I'm going to write a tear stained letter
I'm going to tell you one more time
That you still could reconsider
And come back to being mine
And if you think about what I'm saying
It'd be hard to refuse
Just be sure you think a long time
On the answer that you choose
It will be a most important piece
Of personal, private news
I'm going to write a tear stained letter
Mark it ""Personal Private News""
And I hope you'll keep it to yourself
And don't go around crying the blues
Giving off a bad impression
As to what went really wrong
When what it was was that suddenly
The music was all gone
And this man and this woman got cut off
In the middle of our song
I'm going to write a tear stained letter
I'm going to put it to a tune
So I'll be sending with it
A sweet melody for you
And not some red-hot, upbeat zinger
That'll set your body on fire
But a hunk of love included
Meant to take you a little higher
And to settle on your sweet, sweet mind
At night when you retire

I'm going to write a tear stained letter1Embed"

When life seems full
Of clouds and rain
And I'm full
Of nothing but pain
Who soothes my thumping, bumping brain?
Nobody
When Wintertime comes
With its snow and sleet
And me with hunger
And cold feet
Who says ""Here's two bits, go and eat""?
Nobody

Well, I have never done nothing to nobody
I have never got nothing from nobody, no time
And until I get something from somebody, sometime
I don't intend to do nothing for nobody, no time

When Summertime comes
All warm and clear
And my friends see me
Drawing near
Who says ""come on in and have a beer""?
Nobody
Well one time when things was
Looking bright
I started to whittling on a stick one night
Who said ""Hey! That's dynamite!""?

"Drums Lyrics[Verse 1]
From the Indian reservation to the governmental school
Well they're going to educate me to the white men's Golden Rule
And I'm learning very quickly for I've learned to be ashamed
And I come when they call Billy though I've got an Indian name

[Chorus]
And there are drums beyond the mountain Indian drums that you can't hear
There are drums beyond the mountain and they're getting mighty near

[Verse 2]
And when they think that they'd changed me cut my hair to meet their needs
Will they think I'm white or Indian quarter blood or just half breed
Let me tell you Mr teacher when you say you'll make me right
In five hundred years of fighting, not one Indian turned white
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well you thought that I knew nothing when you brought me here to school
Just another empty Indian just America's first fool
But now I can tell you stories that are burnt and dried and old
But in the shadow of their telling walks the thunder proud and bold

There's Magnus Colorado with his sleeves so red and full

Well you may teach me this land's history but we taught it to you first

"Down There by the Train LyricsThere's a place I know where the train goes slow
Where the sinner can be washed in the blood of the lamb
There's a river by the trestle down by sinner's grove
Down where the willow and the dogwood grow

You can hear the whistle, you can hear the bell
From the halls of heaven to the gates of hell
And there's room for the forsaken if you're there on time
You'll be washed of all your sins and all of your crimes

If you're down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train goes slow
There's a golden moon that shines up through the mist
And I know that your name can be on that list
There's no eye for an eye, there's no tooth for a tooth
I saw Judas Iscariot carrying John Wilkes Booth

[Chorus]
He was down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train goes slow

[Verse 3]
If you've lost all your hope, if you've lost all your faith
I know you can be cared for and I know you can be safe
And all the shamefuls and all of the whores
And even the soldier who pierced the side of the Lord

[Chorus]
Is down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train goes slow

[Verse 4]
Well, I've never asked forgiveness and I've never said a prayer
Never given of myself, never truly cared
I've left the ones who loved me and I'm still raising Cain
I've taken the low road and if you've done the same
[Chorus]
Meet me down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train goes slow

[Chorus]
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train goes slowEmbed"
"I Don’t Hurt Anymore Lyrics[Verse 1]
It don't hurt anymore
All my tear drops have dried
No more walkin the floors
With that burning inside
Just to think it could be
Time has opened the door
And at last, I am free
I don't hurt anymore

[Chorus]
No yesterday night
I wanted to die
The day you said we were through
But now that i find you're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's true
I forgotten somehow
That i cared so before
And its wonderful now
I don't hurt anymoreEmbed"
"Four Strong Winds Lyrics[Chorus]
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
All these things that won't change, come what may
Well our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

[Verse 1]
Think I'll go out to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall
Got some friends that I can go to working for
Yet I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If I get there before the snow flies, and if things are looking good
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare
But by then it would be winter, not much for you to do
And the winds can sure blow cold way up there

When you're all alone and blue
No one to tell your troubles to
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
When this world turns you down
Not a true friend can be found
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you

[Pre-Chorus]
And through all kinds of weather
You'll find, I'll never change
Through the sunshine and the shadows
I'll always be the same

We're together right or wrong
Where you go I'll tag along
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you

"To Beat the Devil Lyrics[Intro]
And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June, who helped show me how to beat the devil

[Verse 1]
It was winter time in Nashville, down on music row
And I was looking for a place to get myself out of the cold
To warm the frozen feeling that was eating at my soul
And keep the chilly wind off me and my guitar

[Verse 2]
Well, my thirsty wanted whisky; and my hungry needed beans
But it'd been of month of paydays since I'd heard that eagle scream
So with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar

[Verse 3]
Actually, I guess you'd could call it a Tavern
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling, sawdust on the floor
Friendly shadows
[Verse 4]
Well, I saw that there was just one old man, that was sitting at the bar
And in the mirror I could see him checking me and my guitar
An' he turned and said: ""Come up here boy, and show us what you are
I said: ""I'm dry."" He bought me a beer

[Verse 5]
Then he nodded at my guitar and said: ""It's a tough life, ain't it?""
I just looked at him and he said: ""You ain't making any money, are you?""
I said: ""You've been reading my mail""
He just smiled and said: ""Let me see that guitar
I've got something you oughta hear""
Then he laid it on me

[Verse 6]
If you waste your time a-talking to the people who don't listen
To the things that you are saying, who do you think's going to hear
And if you should die explaining how the things that they complain about
Are things they could be changing who do you think's going to care?

[Verse 7]
There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time
All the truth remains that no-one wants to know
[Verse 8]
Well, the old man was a stranger, but I'd heard his song before
Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door
When no-one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor
And lonesome was more than a state of mind

[Verse 9]
You see, the devil haunts a hungry man
If you don't wanna join him,  well you gotta beat him
I ain't saying I beat the devil, but I drank his beer for nothing
And then I stole his song

[Verse 10]
And you still can hear me singing to the people who don't listen
To the things that I am saying, praying someone's going to hear
And I guess I'll die explaining how the things that they complain about
Are things they could be changing, hoping someone's going to care

[Outro]
I was born a lonely singer, and I'm bound to die the same
But I've got to feed the hunger in my soul
And if I never have a nickle, I won't ever die ashamed
Cause I don't believe that no-one wants to knowEmbed"
"Cool Water Lyrics[Verse 1]
All day I've faced a barren waste
Without the taste of water, cool water
Old Dan and I with throats burnt dry
And souls that cry for water
Cool, clear, water

[Chorus]
Keep moving, Dan, don't you listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can you see that big, green tree
Where the water's running free
And it's waiting there for me and you
It's water, cool, clear water
[Verse 2]
The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water
Cool water
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water
Cool, clear, water

[Chorus]Embed"
"Devil Went Down to Georgia LyricsIt's been ten long years since
The devil laid his fiddle at Johnny's feet
And it burned inside his mind
The way he suffered that defeat

In the darkest pits of hell
The devil hatched an evil plan
To tempt the fiddle player for
He's just a mortal man

""The sin of pride,"" the devil
Cried is what will do you in
""I thought we had this settled
I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny did you ever know
That time keeps marching on?
The coldest hour is the one
Comes just before the dawn
The devil's back in Georgia
Will you stand up to the test
Or will you let the
Devil be the best?

In truth, I haven't played much
Since the baby came in June
But give me half a minute an'
I'll get this fiddle back in tune

The devil grabbed the golden
Fiddle out of Johnny's hand and said
""Though I'm the fiddle player
Underground and I walk upon the land""

Y'all just better be just turnin'
Back if you want this boy to win
'Cos practice is the only cure for
The predicament he's in

Now devil it would be a sin
For you to get my bow
You go on back to hell and to
The wood shed I will go

Johnny are you practicing or
Will your hands grow cold?
The devil walks the land and
Plays a fiddle made of gold
Can you hear the babe a crying
Will he ever know?
The devil wants
His daddy's very soul?

Before we play, I want to thank you
For letting God's own Word ring true
He said, ""You can't be trusted
Yes but what you gonna do?""

Well you get your fiddle devil if
You think that you can win
'Cos I beat you once you old dog
And I can whip your butt again

John Brown's green, the devil is red
Mama's little baby loves short-nymph bread
The devil's dream is that he can win
But Johnny is the best that's ever beenEmbed"
"Cowboy’s Prayer LyricsLord, I've never lived where churches grow
I loved creation better as it stood
That day you finished it so long ago
And looked upon your work and called it good
I know that others find you in the light
That sifted down through tinted window panes
And yet I seem to feel you near tonight
In this dim, quiet starlight on the plains
I thank you, Lord, that I'm placed so well
That you've made my freedom so complete
That I'm no slave to whistle, clock or bell
Nor weak eyed prisoner of Waller Street
Just let me live my life as I've begun
And give me work that's open to the sky
Make me a partner of the wind and sun
And I won't ask a life that's soft or high
Let me be easy on the man that's down
Let me be square and generous with all
I'm careless sometimes, Lord, when I'm in town
But never let them say I'm mean or small
Make me as big and open as the plains
And honest as the horse between my knees
Clean as a wind that blows behind the rains
Free as the hawk that circles down the breeze
Forgive me, Lord, if sometimes I forget
You know about the reasons that are hid
You understand the things that gall or fret
Well, you knew me better than my mother did
Just keep an eye on all that's done or said
And right me sometimes when I turn aside
And guide me on that long, dim trail ahead
That stretched upward toward the great divideEmbed"
"The Christmas Guest Lyrics[Verse]
It happened one day near December's end
Two neighbors called on an old friend
And they found his shop so meager and lean
Made gay with thousand bows of green
And Conrad was sitting with face a-shine
When he suddenly stopped as he stitched a twine
And he said ""Old friends, at dawn today
When the cock was crowing the night away
The Lord appeared in a dream to me
And said ""I'm coming your guest to be.""
So I've been busy with feet astir
Strewing my shop with branches of fern
The table is spread and the kettle is shined
And over the rafters the holly is twined
Now I'll wait for my Lord to appear
And listen closely so I will hear
His step as He nears my humble place
And I'll open the door and look on His face
So his friends went home and left Conrad alone
For this was the happiest day he had known
For long since, his family had passed away
And Conrad had spent many a sad Christmas Day
But he knew with the Lord as his Christmas Guest
This Christmas would be the dearest and best
So he listened with only joy in his heart
And with every sound he would rise with a start
And look for the Lord to be at his door
Like the vision he had had a few hours before
So he ran to the window after hearing a sound
But all he could see on the snow covered ground
Was a shabby beggar whose shoes were torn
And all of his clothes were ragged and worn
But Conrad was touched and he went to the door
And he said, ""You know, your feet must be frozen and sore
I have some shoes in my shop for you
And a coat that will keep you warmer too.""
So with grateful heart the man went away
But Conrad noticed the time of day
And wondered what made the Lord so late
And how much longer he'd have to wait
When he heard a knock, he ran to the door
But it was only a stranger once more
A bent old lady with a shawl of black
With a bundle of kindling piled on her back
She asked for only a place to rest
But that was reserved for Conrad's Great Guest
But her voice seemed to plead ""Don't send me away
Let me rest for awhile on Christmas Day""
So Conrad brewed her a steaming cup
And told her to sit at the table and sup
But after she left he was filled with dismay
For he saw that the hours were slipping away
And the Lord hadn't come as he said he would
Then Conrad felt sure he had misunderstood
When out of the stillness he heard a cry
""Please help me and tell me where am I?""
So again he opened his friendly door
And stood disappointed as twice before
It was only a child who'd wandered away
And was lost from her family on Christmas Day
Again Conrad's heart was heavy and sad
But he knew he should make the little girl glad
So he called her in and he wiped her tears
And quieted all her childish fears
Then he led her back to her home once more
But as he entered his own darkened door
He knew the Lord was not coming today
For the hours of Christmas had passed away
So he went to his room and knelt down to pray
And he said ""Dear Lord, why did you delay?
What kept you from coming to call on me?
For I wanted so much your face to see.""
When soft in the silence a voice he heard
""Lift up your head for I kept my word
Three times my shadow crossed your floor
And three times I came to your lonely door
I was the beggar with bruised, cold feet
And I was the woman you gave something to eat
I was the child on the homeless street
Three times I knocked, and three times I came in
And each time I found the warmth of a friend
Of all the gifts, love is the best
And I was honored to be your Christmas GuestEmbed"

"The Last Gunfighter Ballad Lyrics[Verse 1]

The old gunfighter stood on the porch and stared into sun
And relived all the old days back when he was living by the gun
When deadly games of pride were played and
Living was mistakes not made

And the thought of the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
The thought of the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

And it's always keep your back to the sun
And you can almost feel the weight of that gun
And it's faster than snakes or a blink of the eye
And it's a time for all slow men to die
His eyes get squinty and he's straight as log
And he empties his gun at the dirty dog
And he's hit by  the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Hit by the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

Now the burn of a bullet is only a scar
And he's back in his chair in front of a bar
And the streets are empty and the blood's all dried
The dead are dust and and the whiskey's inside
So buy him a drink and lend him an ear
He's nobody's fool but he's the only one here

Who remembers the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Remembers the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

Son I stood in that street before it was paved
I learned the shoot or be shot before I could shave
And I did it all for the money and the fame
Noble was nothing but feeling no shame
And nothing was sacred but staying alive
And all that I learned from a Colt 45

Was to cuss the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
To cuss the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Now he's just an old man that nobody believes
Says he's a gunfighter, the last of this breed
And there's ghosts in the street seeking revenge
Calling him out to the lunatic fringe
He's out in the traffic now checking the sun
And he's killed by a car as he goes for his gun

So much for the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
So much for the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke3Embed"

"I’m Free from the Chain Gang Now LyricsI got rid of the shackles that bound me
And the guards that were always around me
There were tears on the mail mother sent me in jail
But I'm free from the chain gang now

Back home I was known and respected
Then one day I was wrongly suspected
So they put me in chains in a cold freezing rain
But I'm free from the chain gang now

All the years I was known by a number
How I kept my mind is a wonder
But like a bird in a tree I got my liberty
And I'm free from the chain gang now

I got rid of the shackles that bound me

When your dancing shoes have lost their shine I'm going to be gone in mine

You might have to give up a jewel or two
Eat your heart out anyway it's hard as your head
And it's cold as clay

Your sugar daddy or your money tree
I'm leaving now yeah I'm leaving now
Get out of my space get out of my face
I'm leaving now hey I'm leaving now
Pull up the collar on my traveling coat
Sell that miserable pleasure boat
I wouldn't give a nickel for another buck
I'm living on muscle guts and luck
If anybody asks where did I go
Tell them I went where the wild goose go
They won't even have me an area code

She said ""Mr. Bartender
Has my lovin' Johnny been here?
He's my man, he wouldn't do me wrong""

I ain't gonna tell you no story
I ain't gonna tell you no lie
Johnny left here 'bout an hour ago

If he's your man, he's doin' you wrong
Frankie looked over the transom
And much to her surprise
There on a cot sat Johnny
Making love to Nellie Bly
She said ""He's my man
But he's doin' me wrong""

Roll out your rubber tired buggy
Roll out your rubber tired hack
She's taking her man to the graveyard
But she ain't gonna bring him back

This story has no end

You know there's been a lot of times that I didn't have a dime

So if you push me down he'll pick me up
And he'll stick by me when the going gets tough

Well he's the great emancipator and my heart regulator (Jesus is) yes he is
He'll make my way brighter and my burdens lighter yes he will (Jesus will)
Well you may scorn me turn your back on me

And he fights down the devil till he makes him give up

In your mind
One foot on Jacob's ladder and one foot in the fire
And it all goes down in your mind

You're still young that's your fault there's so much you have to know
Find a boy settle down and if you want you can marry
Look at me gettin' old but I'm happy

I was once like you are now and I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you found somethin' going on
But take your time think a lot why think of every thing you've got
For you'll still be here tomorrow but your dreams may not

How can I try to explain cause when I do he turns away again
And it's always been the same same old story
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away

It's not time to make a change just sit down and take it slowly
You're still young that's your fault there's so much you have to go through
Find a boy settle down and if you want you can marry
Look at me gettin' old but I'm happy
All the times that I have cried keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard but it's harder to ignore it (oh stay)
If they were right I'd agree but it's them that know not me
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away I know I have to go away
(Oh please stay please don't go away)Embed"
"A Legend in My Time Lyrics[Verse]
If heartaches brought fame in love's crazy game
I'd be a legend in my time
If they gave gold statuettes for tears and regrets
I'd be a legend in my time
But they don't give awards, and there's no praise or fame
For hearts that are broken for love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim
Everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my timeEmbed"
"For the Good Times Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on, and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning

[Chorus]
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times

[Verse 2]
I'll get along, you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me

"Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right Lyrics[Verse]
It isn't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter, anyhow
And it isn't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm traveling on
Don't think twice, it's all right

It isn't no use in turning on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
And it isn't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right
It isn't no use in calling out my name, girl
Like you never did before
It isn't no use in calling out my name, girl
I can't hear you any more
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

I'm walking down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, girl
So I'll just say fare thee well
I am not saying you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all rightEmbed"
"Country Trash LyricsI got a crib full of corn and a turning plow
But the ground's too wet for the hopper now
Got a cultivator and a double tree
A leather line for the haw and gee
Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
I'm doing alright for country trash

I'm saving up dimes for a rainy day
I got about a dollar laid away
The wind's from the south and the fishing's good
Got a potbelly stove a cord of wood
Mama turns the left-overs into hash
I'm doing alright for country trash

I got a mackinaw wand a hunting dog
A cap I ordered from the catalog
A big tall tree that shades the yard
A big fat sow for the winter's lard
Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
I'm doing alright for country trash
Well there's not much new ground left to plow
And crops need fertilizing now
My hands don't earn me too much gold
For security when I grow old
But we'll all be equal under the grass
And God's got a heaven for country trash
And God's got a heaven for country trash
I'll be doing alright for country trashEmbed"
"Peace in the Valley Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh well, I'm tired and so weary
But I must go alone
Till the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well the morning's so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes

[Chorus]
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me

[Verse 2]
Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes

"Pocahontas LyricsAurora borealis
The icy sky at night
Paddles cut the water
In a long and hurried flight
From the white man
To the fields of green
And the homeland
We've never seen

They killed us in our tepee
They cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Cryin' on the ground
But the firesticks
And the wagons come
And the night falls
On the setting sun
They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little box
At the top of the stairs
With my Indian rug
And a pipe to share

I wish I was a trapper
I would give a thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And find out how she felt
In the mornin'
On the fields of green
In the homeland
We've never seen

And maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
We'll sit and talk about Hollywood
And the good things there for hire
Like the Astrodome
And the first tepee
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me

"I Won’t Have to Cross Jordan Alone Lyrics[Verse]
When I come to the river at the ending of day
When the last winds of sorrow have blown
There'll be somebody waiting to show me the way I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan alone Jesus died all my sins to atone
In the darkness I see he'll be waiting for me I won't have to cross Jordan alone
Often times I'm weary and troubled and sad
When it seems that my friends have all flon
There is one thought that cheers me and makes my heart glad
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan
Though the billows of trouble and sorrow may sweep
Christ the Saviour will care for his own
Untill the end of my journey my soul he will keep and I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross JordanEmbed"
"White Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am stunned and I am broken and my head is in my hand
For she who said she love me will not wed an Indian man
My Gods who were wild ridden stand quiet by my side
For although I loved her she would not be my bride

[Chorus]
Oh goodbye softly sweet one it was splendid while it ran
Goodbye, my bitter white girl, I'll forget you if I can

[Verse 2]
She came up to the pueblo with her bright blonde hair
They told me not to love her but I did not care
She took me to her parties, she carried me around
And I was a proud one, the tallest man in town
For I found great wonder all wrapped in brilliant dreams
I held her strong but gentle as kings have held their queens
I learned to drink strong whiskey as she took me here and there
Until life without my whiskey, I could not bear
[Chorus]
Oh goodbye softly sweet one it was splendid while it ran
Goodbye, my bitter white girl, I'll forget you if I can

[Verse 3]
Well when she came to leave me she took me by the arm
And she said she loved me and would not do me harm
But she would not marry not an Indian she said
She thanked me for my offer and I wished that I was dead
Now I'm back among my people and they are kind to me
Although I'm sad with staggers when I drink that tough whiskey
For I've been a white girl's pet, a captive Indian
Shown off and discarded just a drunk who might have been

[Chorus][x2]
Oh goodbye softly sweet one it was splendid while it ran
Goodbye, my bitter white girl, I'll forget you if I canEmbed"
"If the Good Lord’s Willing Lyrics[Verse]
If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays down
I'll be in your arms, time the moon come around
For a taste of love that's shining in your eyes
If the rooster crows at the cracking of the dawn
I'll be there just as sure as you're born
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
I'll comb my hair down, brush my teeth
Shine up, slick up, dress up neat
Get everything looking just right
Because I want to look pretty when I see you tonight
Just as sure as the rabbits are a jumping in the holler
I'll be there, you can bet your bottom dollar
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays low
I'll be there a knocking at your door
With a hug and a kiss for the one I idolize
I'll wear my suit, my Sunday best, I'll be there looking my best
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
I'll feed the mules and slop the hogs
Feed the cows and chop all the logs
Get all of my working done
'Cause tonight we're going to have lots of fun
Just as sure as there ever was a preacher man
I'll be there with a ring for your hand
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't riseEmbed"
"Before My Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know that hearts were loving
Long before I was here
And I'm not the first to ever cry
In my bed or in my beer
There were songs before there was radio
Of love that stays and love that goes
They were writing meloncholy tunes
And tearful words that rhyme

[Chorus]
Before my time[x2]

[Verse 2]
There were songs in old dusty books
Of love thats always been
Sweet lovers in their glory
Who are now gone with the wind
Old fashion love words spoken then
Keep coming back around again
Nothings changed except the names
Their love burns just like mine
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And in the dim of yesterday
I can clearly see
That flesh and blood cried out to someone
As it does in me
And there was some old song that said
I love you 'til I die

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
But what the old time masters had
Is what I feel for you
Love is love and doesn't change
In a century or two
If someway they had seen and knew
How it would be for me and you
They'd wish for love like yours
And they would wish for love like mine
Before my time2Embed"
"The Talking Leaves Lyrics[Verse]
Sequoia's winters were sixteen silent tongue spirit clean
He walked at his father's side
Across the smoking battle ground where red and white men lay all around
So many here had died
The wind had scattered around snow white leaves upon the ground
Not leaves like leaves from trees
Sequoia said what can this be what's the strange thing here I see
From where come leaves like these
Sequoia turned to his father's eyes and he said father you're wise
From where come such snow white leaves
With such strange marks upon these squares
Not even the wise owl could put them there
So strange these snow white leaves
His father shielding his concern resenting the knowledge Sequoia yearned
Crumbled the snow white leaves
He said when I explain then it's done these are talking leaves my son
The white men's talking leaves
The white man takes a berry of black and red
And an eagle's feather from the eagle's bed
And he makes bird track marks
And the marks on the leaves they say carry messages to his brother far away
And his brother knows what's in his heart
They see these marks and they understand the truth in the heart of the far off man
The enemies can't hear them
Said Sequoia's father son they weave bad medicine on these talking leaves
Leave such things to them
Then Sequoia walking lightly followed his father quietly but so amazed was he
If the white man talks on leaves why not the Cherokee
Vanished from his father's face Sequoia went from place to place
But he could not forget
Year after year he worked on and on till finally he cut into stone
The Cherokee alphabet
Sequoia's hair by now was white his eyes began to lose their light
But he taught all who would believe
That the Indian's thoughts could be written down
Just as the white men's there on the ground and he left us these talking leavesEmbed"

Ha ha ha, Come on, bad news, ha ha
Well, bad news travels like wild fire, good news travels slow
They all call me Wildfire, ha ha, because everybody knows
I'm bad news everywhere I go

Always getting in trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go
They tried to hang me in Oakland and the did in Francisco
But I wouldn't choke, I broke their rope and they had to let me go
Because I'm bad news everywhere I go

Well, now I've picked peaches in Georgia, I lumber jacked in Maine

Oh you wild raging river like my woman's lips you lure me
Pied piper of the desert roll on to the sea
You're the same at noon or midnight and I follow where you go

If I had no love of life I'd become part of your flow
But I fear the place you'd take me you wild Colorado

Oh you wild raging river from the fountains of the mountains
You ripple down the valleys growing wide and swift and deep
With what powed you cut your canyons how long ago
You're as wayward as my woman you wild Colorado

"Chattanooga City Limit Sign Lyrics[Verse]
I was thumbing a ride one Saturday morning
Out of Nashville toting my sack
I lent my car to a girl that lived in Chattanooga
And she hadn't brought it back
She was drinking pretty heavy when I let her have it
I hope she knows it was only a loan
There's no telling what I might have told her back at the time
But that old car was also my home
About five miles out I was getting kind of tired
Sweating hard and feeling kind of weak
I woke up with no cigarettes and nothing to drink
And I hadn't had a bite to eat
My nerves were so quick I couldn't tell where I was shaking
Then a set of brakes sang my song
Some fellow stuck his head out a '57 Chevy
And hollered, hey man come on
I told them I was heading down to Chattanooga
They said, hop in we're going there too
And the way they took off in a cloud of smoke
I still can't believe it was true
They had their windows down and I was sitting in the back
With my tongue still hung in my throat
He was hitting just about a hundred and ten
And he said, man what do you think of this boat
Well there was two semis struggling up ahead
One trying to pass the other
They had the whole road blocked so he passed them on the right
And let me tell you something brother
I was so nervous that my teeth was clicking
There wasn't any way my head could think
Then the one that was sitting on the passenger side
Turned and said, hey man you want something to drink
I just shook my head because I couldn't talk
He said okay and then he said cheers
The fools were drinking whiskey and wine
And chasing it down with beer
Well I started sweating that old sticky sweat
And I know I was white as a sheep
Then one turned the radio on wide open
And said, hey man check that beat
By the time we reached the top of Monteagle
I thought I heard a rumbling sound
And then I saw a sign that said falling rock
And right there I was floorboard bound
I was rolling and squirming on the old floorboard
Too weak to sit or stand
And then the driver said we're doing a hundred and twenty
Look, here man no hands
I got up enough nerve to raise up and look
And by now there couldn't be no surprise
But his hair was blowing all over my face
And dandruff blew in both eyes
He never did drive on the right or left
He just kept on riding that line
I rubbed my eyes and saw the prettiest thing
The Chattanooga city limit sign
He slowed down and I said
Mister, please I'd like to get off right here
He said, aw ride on into town with us
We're gonna go down and pick up some more beer
I said, please, once more and he stopped the car
And then he handed me my sack
Said they'd look for me on the road later on
In case I wanted to catch a ride back
I got out and sat down by the side of the road
Feeling sick and looking mighty pale
I don't remember anything much after that
But next morning I woke up in jail
I didn't know anybody in my cell
And didn't want to ask why was there
But they all kept grinning and turning their heads
And it was more than my head could bear
So I called the jailer and I asked him to tell me
Why I was there if he'd be so kind
He said for stopping the traffic while I was hugging and kissing

"The Little Drummer Boy Lyrics[Verse]
Come, they told me
Our newborn King to see
Our finest gifts we bring
To lay before the King

This is to honor Him
When we come
Baby Jesus, I am a poor boy too
I have no gift to bring
That's fit to give a King

But may I play for You
On my drum?
The Mother Mary nodded
The Ox and Lamb kept time
I played my drum for Him
I played my best for Him

Then He smiled at me
Me and my drumEmbed"
"A Singer of Songs LyricsI'm not a savior, and I'm not a saint
The man with the answers I certainly ain't
I wouldn't tell you what's right or what's wrong
I'm just a singer of songs

But I can take you for a walk along a little country stream
I can make you see through lovers' eyes and understand their dreams
I can help you hear a baby's laugh and feel the joy it brings
Yes, I can do it with the songs I sing
I'm not a prophet, and I'm not a priest
I'm not a wise man who's come from the East
I wouldn't tell you what's right or what's wrong
I'm just a singer of songs

But I can take you to a city where a man was crucified
I can tell you how He lived, and I can tell you why He died
I can help proclaim the glory of this mighty king of kings
Yes, I can do it with the songs I sing
I'm not a great man. I don't claim to be
But when I meet my Maker and He questions me
I won't hang my head. I'll stand proud and strong
And say, ""I was a singer. Lord, I was a singer
Yes, I was a singer of songs.""Embed"
"Blue Train Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's an engine at the station and the whistle calls my name
It's calling, calling, calling, come and get aboard the train
My baby's gone and I'm alone to live in misery
I'm going to call and make a reservation for me

[Chorus]
Going to ride a blue train, going to ride a blue train
Going to ride a blue train, going to ride a blue train

[Verse 2]
I'm going to climb aboard and ride until I learn to smile
I'll be knocking out the blues while I'm knocking out the miles
With my guitar, beat and rhythm, to the click-clack of the wheels
I'm going to sing the blues because that's the way that I feel
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Conductor, go and tell the man to shovel on the coal
It doesn't seem half as bad as long as I can roll
Give me another ticket and I'll stay and ride with you
There's nothing left to live for in this world, we're rolling through

"Oney Lyrics[Intro]
I dedicate this song to the working man
For every man that puts in
Eight or ten hard hours a day of work and toil and sweat
Always got somebody looking down his neck
Trying to get more out of him
Than he really ought to have to put in

[Verse 1]
After twenty-nine long years of working in this shop
With Oney standing over me
Today when that old whistle blows
I'll check in all my gear and I'll retire
The superintendent just dropped by
And said they'd planned my little get together
Then he said I'd never a made it
If old Oney hadn't held me to the fire
[Verse 2]
I've seen him in my dreams at night
And woke up in the morning feeling tired
And old Oney don't remember
When I came here, how he tried to get me fired
With his folded hands behind him
Every morning Oney waited at the gate
Where he'd rant and rave like I committed murder
Clocking in five minutes late

[Verse 3]
But today they'll gather 'round me
Like I've seen them do when any man retires
Then old Oney's going to tell me
From now on I'm free to do what I desire
He'll present me with that little old gold watch
They give a man at times like this
But there's one thing he's not counting on
Today's the day I give old Oney his

[Verse 4]
I've been working, building muscles
Oney's just been standing around a getting soft
And today about four-thirty
I'll make up for every good night's sleep I've lost
When I'm gone I'll be remembered
As the working man who put his point across
With a right hand full of knuckles
Because today I show old Oney who's the boss

Hmmmm! What time is it? Four thirty!
Hey, Oney!
Oney! Ha ha ha ha!Embed"

"Look at Them Beans Lyrics[Verse 1]
This time last year there sure was
A lot of sad faces around this old house
Our papa died without fulfilling his life's dream
Of producing one of the best crops in Grimes County
Though papa died with that dream still in his head
A desire in his heart, a promise on his lips, calluses on both hands
And two dollars in his pocket
Papa didn't live long enough to see his dreams come true
So he died from too much work, broken spirit, I guess
But I promised our mama that if it was a last thing he'd ever do
He'd live long enough to see just one good crop come through
But you see we can't plan on things without first talking to God
Because we don't know his plans
And if we don't include him my friends the way can get mighty hard
They say that every time a good and righteous person
Is buried in God's good earth it's just fertilizer for the soil
And I guess there must be some truth to that
Whether we believe it or not
I just wish that papa was here right now
So that he could see this good crop that we finally got
[Chorus]
Hey look at that beans and look at that corn
And I bet them watermelons must be three feet long
Man look at them tomatoes and look at them peas
Well I know if papa was here right now he'd sure be pleased

[Verse 2]
And papa would sure be proud of his children too
My brother's famous now got his own show on the road
Traveling in customized bus imported from Europe
That boy always did love music and he loves to travel
I got a sister that's got a good job in a beauty shop
Making money, making other people look good
Isn’t nobody here at a house now but me and mama
And mama she's getting weaker and she's getting older every day
And she talks softly about joining papa in his heavenly home
But that woman sure did love that man
She worked beside papa for forty some odd years
Trying to produce a good crop and never could grow a single bean
But I just wish that papa was here right now
To see this good crop that we finally got

[Chorus]
Man, look at that beans and look at that corn
And I bet them watermelons must be three feet long
[Chorus]
Man, look at them tomatoes and look at them peas
Well, I know if papa was here right now he'd sure be pleased
And papa, if you can hear me look at them beansEmbed"
"Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Would you lay with me in a field of stone?
If my needs were strong, would you lay with me?
Should my lips grow dry, would you wet them dear
In the midnight hour if my lips were dry?

Would you go away to another land?
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand?
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand
If I give myself to you?

Will you bathe me with me in the stream of life?
When the moon is full will you bathe with me?
Will you still love me when I'm down and out?
In my time of trial, will you stand by me?

I'll more than share each pain that you endure
And when you're in the autumn of your years
You'll call me in the night and I'll be near
I love you and I'll let you know I do
I promise you I promise you

I promise you for better or for worse
I'll stand by you as I did at the first
And when you're in the winter of your years
I'll be right by your side to dry your tears
Yes I'll be the same through all that we go through
I promise you I promise you
I promise you I promise youEmbed"
"Remember the Alamo Lyrics[Verse 1]
And a hundred and eighty were challenged by Travis to die
By the line that he drew with his sword when the battle was nigh
Any man that would fight to the death crossed over
But him that would live, better fly
And over the line went a hundred and seventy nine

[Chorus]
Hey Santa Anna, we're killing your soldiers below!
That men, wherever they go will remember the Alamo

[Verse 2]
Bowie lay dying, but his powder was ready and dry
Flat on his back, Bowie killed him a few in reply
And young David Crockett was singing and laughing
With gallantry fears in his eyes
For God and for freedom, a man more than willing to die
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And then they sent a young scout from the battlements, bloody and loud
With the words of farewell from a garrison valiant and proud
Grieve not little darling, my dying, if Texas is sovereign and free
We'll never surrender and ever with liberty be

[Chorus]Embed"
"When He Reached Down His Hand for Me Lyrics[Intro]
When he reached down his hand for me

[Verse]
Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way I was wretched and vile as could be
But my Saviour in love gave me peace from above
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down his hand for me when he reached way down for me
I was lost and undone without my God or his son
When he reached down his hand for me
I was near to despair when he came to me there
And he showed me that I could be free
Then he lifted my feet gave me gladness complete

[Outro]
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached downEmbed"
"Muddy Waters Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mary, grab the baby, river's rising
Muddy water taking back the land
Old frame house, she can't take one more beating
It's no use to stay and make a stand
Well, the morning light showed water in the valley
Daddy's grave just went below the line
Things to save, you just can't take them with you
The flood will swallow all you leave behind

[Chorus]
Won't be back to start all over
Because what I felt before is gone
Mary, take the child, river's rising
Muddy water taking back my home
[Steel Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
The road is gone, there's just one way to leave here
Turn my back on what I've left below, oh
Shifting lands, broken farms around me
Muddy waters changing all I know
Hard to say just what I'm losing
I've never felt so all alone
Mary, take the child, river's rising
Muddy water taking back my home

"The Greatest Cowboy of Them All Lyrics[Verse]
I have always had my heroes I've loved a lot of legends
Many men in my mind are riding tall
But my cowboy hero hats off to the man who rode a donkey
He's the greatest cowboy of them all
He loves all his little doggies he speaks to them kind and gently
And he'll lift up any maverick that falls
He sees every stray that scatters like it's the only one that matters
He's the greatest cowboy of them all
Once he rode into the sunset but some returning sunrise
He'll call up all the riders in the sky
I gotta get my roll together gettin' ready for that sunrise
That winds up where old cowboys never die
The trail he rides is narrow but it's straighter than an arrow
And he rides point for all the great and small
He will take us through the wire onto that plain that's higher
He's the greatest cowboy of them all
[Outro]
Once he rode into the sunset
He's the greatest cowboy of them allEmbed"
"Memories Are Made of This Lyrics[Verse 1]
Take one fresh and tender kiss
Add one stolen night of bliss

[Chorus 1]
One girl, one boy, some grief, some joy
Memories are made of this

[Verse 2]
Don't forget a small moonbeam
Fold it lightly with a dream

[Chorus 2]
Your lips and mine to sip the wine
Memories are made of this
[Bridge]
Then at the wedding bells
One house where lovers dwell
Three little kids for the flavor
Stir carefully through the day
See how the flavor stays
These are the dreams that we will savor

With His blessings from above
Serve it generously with love

One man, one wife, one love for life
Memories are made of this
Memories are made of this
Memories are made of thisEmbed"
"The L & N Don’t Stop Here Anymore Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I was a curly headed baby
My daddy sat me down on his knee
He said, son, go to school and get your letters
Don't you be a dusty coal miner, boy, like me

[Chorus]
I was born and raised at the mouth of hazard hollow
The coal cars rolled and rumbled past my door
But now they stand in a rusty row, all empty
Because the L & N don't stop here anymore

[Verse 2]
I used to think my daddy was a black man
With script enough to buy the company store
But now he goes to town with empty pockets
And his face is white as a February snow
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I never thought I'd learn to love the coal dust
I never thought I'd pray to hear that whistle roar
Oh, god, I wish the grass would turn to money
And those green backs would fill my pockets once more

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Last night I dreamed I went down to the office
To get my pay like a had done before
But the old kudzu vines were covering the door
And there were leaves and grass growing right up through the floor

"The Night Hank Williams Came to Town Lyrics[Verse]
Harry Truman was our president
A coke an burger cost you thirty cents
I was still in love with Mavis Brown
On the night Hank Williams came to town
""I Love Lucy"" debuted on TV
That was one big event we didn't see
Сause no one stayed at home for miles around
It was the night Hank Williams came to town
Mama ironed my shirt and daddy let me take the truck
I drove on out to Grapevine and picked old Mavis up
We hit that county line for one quick round
On the night Hank Williams came to town
A thousand people sweltered in the gym
Then I heard someone whisper, ""Hey, that's him""
That's when the crowd let out this deafening sound
It was the night Hank Williams came to town
On and on he sang into the night
""Jambalaya"", ""Cheating Heart"", ""I Saw the Light""
How'd they get Miss Audrey in that gown
On the night Hank Williams came to town
Mavis had her picture made with Hank outside his car
She said, ""He sure is humble for a Grand Ole Opry Star""
Mavis said: ""Why don't we hang around?
It ain't often that Hank Williams comes to town""
While Hank signed his autograph on Beaulah Rice's fan
Mavis got acquainted with the Drifting Cowboys Band
The effect on all our lives was quite profound
On the night Hank Williams came to townEmbed"
"Man in White LyricsI studied at the feet of a master
Gamaliel we called him, the beauty of the law
I was born of the Tribe of Benjamin, I was a Pharisee
And I could quote from memory the Holy Torah

That day that the Nazarene was brought to trial
It was on a Sabbath eve ,there was a earthquake when He died
Just another passing preacher who came up from Galilee
Blaspheming trouble-maker, we let Him be crucified

Then I thought that I would hear no more about him
But his friends found his tomb empty, claimed that he rose from the dead
Then they said he walked among them with the nail wounds in his hands
That King upon a donkey with a thorn crown on his head

His followers kept growing in great number
And the one that they call Caiaphas mocked us in the judgement hall
And with the Greek name Stephen we knew the gentiles had come in
I cast my vote against him, he was stoned I saw him fall
Then the friends of the Nazarene became united
And I became enraged then led a slaughter zealously
I found their secret places, they were beaten, they were chained
But some of them were scattered, justified in fearing me

Then the Man in White, appeared to me
In such a blinding light it struck me down
With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the Man in White
In gentle loving tone spoke to me
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White

But like the wind that blows the scattered sea
From Alexandria to Antioch their congregation grew
I went to the high priest for letters of permission
To go to other cities, to see my mission through

Six days on the hot road to the masters
And just outside the city in the middle of the day
A great unearthly light struck and overpowered me
Prostrate on the hot road, I was blinded were I laid

Then I thought I heard the rushing of great water
And a multitude of angels singing sweet and heavenly
And through the sound of wind, came a voice so soft and kind
Meant for only me to hear, ""Saul, why do you persecute me?""
As I lay there on the ground, in my blindness
He asked me once again, and suddenly the voice I knew
So finally I managed, a trembling response
Who are you Lord?, I asked him, but I already knew

I am Jesus of Nazareth the voice answered
Arise go to Damascus on the street called Straight will be
A place where you will wait for my servant Ananais
He will open up your eyes, you'll be a witness unto me

So now I live to serve my master
As zealous in his service as I once was as his foe
And keeping his commandments given on Damascus road
I go to all the world, and I let the whole world know

Then the Man in White, appeared to me
In such a blinding light it struck me down
With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the Man in White
In gentle loving tone spoke to me
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White
The Man in White...Embed"
"Meet Me in Heaven Lyrics[Verse 1]
We saw houses falling from the sky
Where the mountains lean down to the sand
We saw blackbirds circling 'round an old castle keep
And I stood on the cliff and held your hand
We walked troubles brooding wind swept hills
And we loved and we laughed the pain away
At the end of the journey, when our last song is sung
Will you meet me in Heaven someday?

[Verse 2]
Can't be sure of how's it's going to be
When we walk into the light across the bar
But I'll know you and you'll know me
Out there beyond the stars
We've seen the secret things revealed by God
And we heard what the angels had to say
Should you go first, or if you follow me
Will you meet me in Heaven someday?
[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Living in a mansion on the streets of gold
At the corner of Grace and Rapture Way
In sweet ecstasy while the ages roll
Will you meet me in Heaven someday?

In sweet ecstasy while the ages roll
Will you meet in Heaven someday?Embed"
"He Stopped Loving Her Today LyricsHe said, ""I'll love you 'til I die.""
She told him, ""You'll forget in time.""
As the years went slowly by
She still prayed upon his mind

He kept her picture on the wall
Went half crazy now and then
But he still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

Kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'

I went to see him just today
But I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

You know, she came to see him last time
And we were all wonderin' if she would
And it kept runnin' through my mind
This time he's over her for good

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her todayEmbed"
"Joe Bean Lyrics[Verse]
Last time we were here at Folsom Prison
They were hanging Joe Bean
Is Joe still here...Joe Bean?
Hang the son of a bitch anyways, right?
Well, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning
For killing a man in Arkansas
Funny thing about it
Joe Bean has never been to Arkansas
On top of that, Joe Bean never heard of the man
In fact, today is Joe Bean's twentieth birthday
See through the prison bars
Joe Bean, see where the gallows stand
Just twenty short years from the day you were born
You died by the hangman's hand
Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning
For a shooting that he never did
He killed 20 men, by the time he was 10, he was an unruly kid
Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean for the one shooting that Joe Bean never did
Well, Joe - your mother is at the Capitol
Asking the governor for a stay
And it's hard on her
Because she knows where you were, on that particular day
You were working Joe Bean, hard working, robbing the Santa Fe
Well, the telegraph wires are humming
Here, the governor's words come through
He said, I can't set you free, it's not up to me, but there's much, Joe Bean, I'll do
I'll join your mother in extending Birthday greetings to you
Happy Birthday, Joe BeanEmbed"
"Don’t Go Near the Water Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your mama used to worry about that big muddy river
Honey do you remember
You let the screen door slam when you stepped off the front porch
Then your mama calling don't be late
And I'd hear your daddy holler, Son she's my only daughter
You'd stick your nose in the honeysuckle down by the gate
I could still hear your mama calling, don't go near the water

[Chorus]
We fell right in
Went over our head
But we didn't go near the water
Nothing beats the young and sweet
And the nights got hotter and hotter
We were sure enough getting our feet wet mama
But we didn't go near the water
[Verse 2]
We'd hear the rocking chair squeaking
As you sneaked up the back stairs
Mama waiting like a grizzly bear
Had to get the honeysuckle out of your hair
But in the morning light
You'd look her right in the eye
It wasn't a lie
We didn't go near the water

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Your mama used to worry about that big muddy river
She should have worried about me

Because we were sure enough getting our feet wet, mama
But we didn't go near the water
Didn't go near the water
Didn't go near the water yeahEmbed"

"Belshazzar Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well the Bible tells about a man
Who ruled Babylon and all it's land
Around the city he built a wall
And declared that Babylon would never fall
He had concubines and wives
He called his Babylon ""Paradise""
Upon his throne he drank and ate
But for Belshazzer it was getting late

[Chorus]
For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand
[Verse 2]
Well the people feast and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time
All holy things were scorned and mocked
Suddenly all their mocking stopped
On the wall there appeared a hand
Nothing else, there was no man
In blood the hand began to write
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well no one around could understand
What was written by the mystic hand
Belshazzar tried but couldn't find
A man who could give him piece of mind
Daniel the prophet, a man of God
He saw the writing on the wall in blood
Belshazzar asked him what it said
And Daniel turned to the wall and read

"Time of the Preacher LyricsIt was the time of the preacher
When the story began
Of the choice of a lady
And the love of a man
And how he loved her so dearly
He went out of his mind
When she left him for someone
She'd left behind
He cried like a baby
He screamed like a panther
In the middle of the night
And he saddled his pony
And he went for a ride
It was the time of the preacher
In the year of '01
Now the preaching is over
And the lesson's begun
But he could not forgive her
Though he tried and he tried, and he tried
And the halls of his memory
Still echo her lies
He cried like a baby
He screamed like a panther
In the middle of the night
And he saddled his pony
And he went for a ride
It was the time of the preacher
In the year of '01
Now the lesson is over
And the killing's begun
It was the time of the preacher
In the year of '01
When you think it's all over
It's only begunEmbed"

Now that drunk-tank in Atlanta

For just a minute there I was dreaming
For just a minute it was all so real
For just a minute she was standing there with me

There's a dream I that I keep having
Where my mama comes to me
And she kneels down over by the window
And says a prayer for me

"Love’s Been Good to Me Lyrics[Chorus]
I have been a rover
I have walked alone
Hiked a hundred highways
Never found a home
Still in all I'm happy
The reason is, you see
Once in a while along the way
Love's been good to me

There was a girl in Denver
Before the summer storm
Oh, her eyes were tender
Oh, her arms were warm
And she could smile away the thunder
Kiss away the rain
Even though she's gone away
You won't hear me complain

There was a girl in Portland
Before the winter chill
We used to go a-courting
Along October hill
And she could laugh away the dark clouds
Cry away the snow
It seems like only yesterday
As down the road I go

"My Old Kentucky Home (Turpentine and Dandelion Wine) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Turpentine and dandelion wine
I've turned the corner, and I'm doing fine
Shooting at the birds on the telephone line
Picking them off with this gun o' mine
Got a fire in my belly and a fire in my head
Going higher and higher until I'm dead
Sister Sue is short and stout
She didn't grow up, she grew out
Mamma says she's plain, but she's just being kind
Papa thinks she's pretty, but he's almost blind
Don't let her out much except at night
But I don't care because I'm all right

[Chorus]
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Young folks roll on the floor
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Keep them hard times away from my door

Brother Gene is big and mean
And he don't have much to say
He had a little woman who he whooped each day
But now she's gone away
Got drunk last night, kicked mamma down the stairs
But I'm all right, so I don't care

Turpentine and dandelion wine

"The Old Account Lyrics[Verse]
Well it was a time on earth when in the books of heaven
An old account was standing for sins yet unforgiven
My name was at the top and many things below
But I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees) long ago (I settled it all)
Yes the old account was settled long ago (hallelujah)
And the record's clear today because he washed my sins away
And the old account was settled long ago
Well the old account was large and growing  every day
And I was always sinning and I never tried to pray
But when I looked ahead and saw such pain and woe
Well I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees)
Now sinner seek the Lord repent of all your sins
Because this he has commanded if you would enter in
And then if you should live a hundred years below
Well you know you got it settled cause you settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees)Embed"
"I Never Picked Cotton Lyrics[Chorus]
I never picked cotton
Like my mother did and my brother did and my sister did
And my daddy died young
Working in a coal mine

[Verse 1]
When I was just a baby
Too little for the cotton sack
I played in the dirt while the others worked
'Til they couldn't straighten up their backs
And I made myself a promise
When I was old enough to run
That I'd never stay a single day
In that Oklahoma sun
[Chorus]
And I never picked cotton
Like my mother did and my brother did and my sister did
And my daddy died young
Working in a coal mine

[Verse 2]
Folks said that I grew up early
And the farm couldn't hold me then
So I stole ten bucks and a pickup truck
And I never went back again
And it was fast cars and whiskey
Long legged girls and fun
I had everything that money could bring
And I took it all with a gun

[Chorus]
And I never picked cotton
Like my mother did and my brother did and my sister did
And my daddy died young
Working in a coal mine

[Verse 3]
It was Saturday night in Memphis
When a redneck grabbed my shirt
And he said, ""Go back to your cotton sack""
I left him lying in the dirt
And they'll take me in the morning
To the gallows just outside
And in the time I got, there ain't a hell of a lot
I can look back on with pride
[Chorus]
But I never picked cotton
Like my mother did and my brother did and my sister did
And my daddy died young
Working in a coal mine
I never picked cotton
Like my mother did and my brother did and my sister did
And my daddy died young
Working in a coal mineEmbed"
"Great Speckled Bird Lyrics[Verse]
What a beautiful thought I am thinking
Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word
All the other birds are flocking around her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God
All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name
Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake
She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky
In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is over
I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look
When He cometh descending from heaven
On the cloud that He writes in His Word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled birdEmbed"
"This Train Is Bound for Glory Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're going ride the Bible train now
No some won't ride, but we're going get on the Bible train
Some ride but not all the way
The Bible train is in the yard now and it's waiting and oh it looks so good
But you might get bored and impatient waiting like those two good brothers over there
They pass around the bottle in the car before they got on the train
Just want to take one more for the road and then, that leads to something else
Well they aren't on the train no more and maybe 9 or 10 got off with them
There's a sister in the church and she says to her friend your husband works at night and so does mine, why don't we just
Get together sometime when they're gone and go downtown and find us some action, well then they got to get off the Bible train
And then another man he's sitting over there looking at a woman in the corner and he's gives her that eye, you know and they
Meet later, secretly, so they got to get off, this train's got a rule against adultery
And while all this is happening the train is getting ready to go, but there's a lot more to get off than different reasons
Just before the train pulls out, but listen its starting to move now, listen to it
Here we go
[Verse 2]
As it leaves the man on the caboose with a long white beard says
This train is bound for glory, this train
This train is bound for glory, this train
This train is bound for glory nobody rides it but the righteous and holy
This train is bound for glory, this train

[Verse 3]
This train is a free train, this train
This train is a free train, this train
This train is a free train
Everybody rides in Jesus' name

This train is a free train, this train

This train it don't pull no liars, this train
This train don't pull no liars, this train
This train don't pull no liars
No false pretenders and no backbiters
This train don't pull no liars, this train

This train is a clean train, this train
This train is a clean train, this train
This train is a clean train
Everybody rides it in Jesus name
This train is a clean train, this train
Do you want to ride it children, this holy train
Do you want to ride it children, this righteous train

Well, Papa, don't you worry about it none now
Everything's going to be all right, Papa
They're teaching us a lesson a day we're learning pretty well too
We've already learned a whole lot of stuff already
Things like

There is no good in an evil-hearted woman
And I'm not cut out to be no Jesse James
And you don't go writing hot cheques down in Mississippi
And there is no good chain gang
There is no good in an evil-hearted woman
And I'm not cut out to be no Jesse James
And you don't go writing hot cheques down in Mississippi
And there is no good chain gang
There is no good in an evil-hearted woman
And I'm not cut out to be no Jesse James
And you don't go writing hot cheques down in Mississippi
And there is no good chain gang
There is no good in an evil-hearted woman
And I'm not cut out to be no Jesse James
And you don't go writing hot cheques down in Mississippi

"(There’ll Be) Peace in the Valley Lyrics""Just before we ask the Statler Brothers to come back out, we'd like to ask the Carter Family and Carl to help us out on a fine scripture. We got a lot of requests to do ""Peace in the Valley.""

Well, I'm tired and so weary but I must go along
Till the Lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well, the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes

(There will be peace in the valley for me some day)
There will be peace in the valley for me dear Lord, I pray
(There'll be no sadness no sorrow no trouble I see)
There will be peace in the valley for me
(For me)

Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolf will be tame
And the lion shall lay down with the lamb, oh yes
And the beast from the wild will be lead by a child
And I'll be changed changed from this creature that I am, oh yes
(There will be peace in the valley for me some day)
There will be peace in the valley for me dear Lord, I pray
(There'll be no sadness no sorrow no trouble I see)
There will be peace in the valley for me

"You Win Again LyricsThe news is out all over town
That you've been seen
Out running around
I know that I
Should leave, but then
I just can't go
You win again

This heart of mine
Could never see
What everybody knew
But me
Just trusting you
Was my great sin
What can I do?
You win again
I'm sorry for
Your victim now
Cause soon his head
Like mine will bow
He'll give his heart
But all in vain
And someday say
You win again

You have no heart
You have no shame
You take true love
And give the blame
I guess that I
Should not complain
I love you still
You win again

"God Will Lyrics[Verse]
God will walk with me down the streets where no one else will walk
God will talk with me of things that no one else will talk
When no one else will walk and no one else will talk
When no one will, God will
God will share with me the little worries no one knows are there
God will care for me whenever there is no one else to care
When no one will be there and no one else will share
When no one will, God will
God will think of me when friends forget and fail to understand
God will strengthen me when I am weak and need a helping hand
When no one understands or lends a helping hand
When no one will, God will, when no one will, God willEmbed"
"I Would Like To See You Again Lyrics[Verse]
I was sitting here thinking about old times, some old times, some old friends
And suddenly it crossed my mind that I would like to see you again
Remember how we used to walk and talk walk and talk holding hands
Said we loved each other, I recall made a lot of future plans
But the years have come and gone and a whole lot has happened since then
But tonight babe, your memory's awfully strong on my mind
And I would like to see you again
It's funny how an old flame comes back, come on back make you blue
But I just saw a picture of a railroad track and some old shack and me and you
Guess I'd better straighten out my mind, straighten it out, go to bed
And pray that I don't dream about old times, some old times, gone and dead
But the years have come and goneEmbed"
"Reverend Mr. Black Lyrics[Verse 1]
He rode easy in the saddle, He was tall and lean
And at first you'd have thought nothing but a streak of mean could make a man look so down right strong
But one look in his eyes and you knew you were wrong
He was a mountain of a man, and I want you to know
He could preach hot hell or freezing snow
He carried a Bible in a canvas sack and folks just called him The Reverend Mr. Black
He was poor as a beggar, but he rode like a king
Sometimes in the evening, I'd hear him sing

[Chorus]
I've got to walk that lonesome valley
I've got to walk it by myself
Oh, nobody else can walk it for me
I got to walk it by myself
You've got to walk that lonesome valley
You've got to walk it by yourself
Oh, nobody else can walk it for you
You've got to walk it by yourself
[Verse 2]
If ever I could have thought this man in black was soft and had any yellow up his back
I gave that notion up the day a lumberjack came in and it wasn't to pray
Yeah, he kicked open the meeting house door and he cussed everybody up and down the floor
Then, when things got quiet in the place, he walked up and cusses in the preacher's face
He hit that Reverend like a kick of a mule and to my way of thinking
It took a real fool to turn the other face to that lumber jack
But that's what he did, The Reverend Mr. Black
He stood like a rock, a man among men and he let that lumberjack hit him again
And then with a voice as quiet as could be, he cut him down like a big oak tree when he said

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's been many years since we had to part
And I guess I learned his ways by heart
I can still hear his sermon's ring, down in the valley where he used to sing
I followed him, yes, sir, and I don't regret it and I hope I will always be a credit to his memory
Because I want you to understand, the Reverend Mr. Black was my old man

"Best Friend Lyrics[Verse 1]
An old man on his deathbed once said to me
You are the master of your destiny

[Chorus 1]
A diamond is a diamond and a stone is a stone
But a man's not all good nor all bad
When the chips are all down and your back's at the wall
You're the best friend that you've ever had
You're the best friend that you've ever had

[Verse 2]
So you laugh when it's time to laugh
And you cry when it's time to cry
Live while it's time to live
'Cause you'll die when it's time to die
Then he closed his eyes and he left me alone
This old man's wisdom brought his meaning home
[Chorus 1]
A diamond is a diamond and a stone is a stone
But a man's not all good nor all bad
When the chips are all down and your back's at the wall
You're the best friend that you've ever had
You're the best friend that you've ever had

[Verse 3]
So you laugh when it's time to laugh
And you cry when it's time to cry
Live while it's time to live
'Cause you'll die when it's time to die
Well now that I'm older I found this is true
The thing that remains is the good that you do

[Chorus 1]
A diamond is a diamond and a stone is a stone
But a man's not all good nor all bad
When the chips are all down and your back's at the wall
God's the best friend that you've ever had
God's the best friend that you've ever had

And you cry when it's time to cry

"Don’t You Think It’s Come Our Time Lyrics[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
I have picked wild roses
Far into september
But I had no one to give the flowers to
I needed a celebration
A September coronation
And I admitted to myself I needed you

[Verse 2: June Carter]
I've watched the gentle winds change
The colors shades of meadows
Ive seen the dew on flowers that had no name
But I let my vase stay empty like my lonely empty heart
Picking flowers for yourself is not the same

[Chorus]
Don't you think its come our time to be together
Lets gather up our scattered words of love and make them rhyme
Let's go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases
Don't you think its come our time
[Verse 3]
Would you take this small bouquet that leaves a fragrance on my fingers
And a feeling that your love is close at hand
Thank you for the flowers, now lets walk through the meadows
Through the brook where our demands caress the sand

[Chorus]
Don't you think its come our time to be together
Lets gather up our scattered words of love and make them rhyme
Let's go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases
Don't you think its come our time

You're telling everyone in town that I don't treat you right
You even say I stay away and don't come home at night
I'm losing you and you are all I've got thanks a lot thanks a lot
It seems you like to hurt me and you know I'm good to you
I'd give you anything I own do anything you want me to
Yeah now you really got me on the spot thanks a lot thanks a lot
Still I would forgive you if you'd let me I'd be glad if we could try again
But it seems that you're just out to get me
And it looks as if you're just about to win
No matter what you do I'll always do love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
And you're calling me those things you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot

No matter what you do I always do love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
You say I'm happy but you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot thanks a lotEmbed"
"The Battle of New Orleans Lyrics[Verse 1]
In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans

[Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a'coming
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to running on
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 2]
We looked down the river and we see'd the British come
And there must have been a hundred of'em beating on the drum
They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring
We stood by our cotton bales and didn't say a thing
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Old Hickory said we could take them by surprise
If we didn't fire our muskets until we looked them in the eye
We held our fire until we see'd their faces well
Then we opened up with squirrel guns and really gave them ... well

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch them
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
We fired our cannon until the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch them
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico1Embed"
"Folk Singer LyricsAs I walk these narrow streets where a million passing feet have throd before me
With my guitar in my hand suddenly I realize nobody knows me
Where yesterday the multitudes screamed and cried my name out for a song
Today the streets are empty and the crowds have all gone home

I pass a million houses but there is no place where I belong
All I knew to give it was song after song after song
All the truth I try to tell you were as distant to you as the moon
Born 200 years too late and 200 years too soon

I'm a child of this age locked inside the pages of your book
And when I am but dust and clay and other children stop take look
Will they marvel at the miracles I did perform and to the heights I did inspire
Or will they tear out the pages of the book to light a fire?

With the rain on my face there is no place where I belong
Did you forget the folk singer so soon?
And did you forget my song?Embed"

(Laughter, applause)

""We got all kinds of songs, here's one called ""A Boy Named Sue."" You wanna hear that one? You wanna hear ""A Boy Named Sue?"" I do too. I'm anxious to hear it. I don't know how the hell it's going to sound! I'm anxious to hear it. Does that block your camera view there, is that all right? Can I leave it there? I'm gonna put it there, then. Where the hell is my guitar? Oh, here it is...""

""Sorry to say that Luther passed away seven months ago, after being with us thirteen years, Luther Perkins. And the fella who's playing the guitar with us now is doing a wonderful job, but of course, nobody can really replace Luther. How about one big cheer for Luther Perkins?""

""Hey, I had a song called ""San Quentin that I was gonna do. Where's my - hey, in my kit back there where I got all my dope-I mean, where I got all my things - (laughter). There's a little red notebook back there, would one of the guards bring it to me? Bring me the red notebook and I will... Hey, that briefcase back there of mine, that's got all the songs I stole in it? Tellin' it like it is, ain't I?""

""Wrote a song yesterday. I tried, it takes a lot of imagination sometimes to write a song and put something into it where somebody else can understand it and feel it. We've been in several prisons; San Quentin, Folsom Prison and the Starkville, Mississippi jail, the El Paso jail, and... You wouldn't believe it, one night I got in the Starkville, Mississippi jail for picking flowers. I was walking down the street, I may sing that one for you a little bit later on, I was walking down the street - what? Excuse me, I couldn't hear you, I was talking. I was walking down the street and, you know, going to get me some cigarettes or something, about 2:00 in the morning after a show, I think it was. Anyway, I reached down to pick up a dandelion here and a daisy here, and this car pulls up, said ""get it the hell in here, boy, what are you doing?"" I said, ""I'm just picking flowers."" Well, $36 for picking flowers and a night in jail. God damn, you can't hardly win, can you? Damn! No telling what they'd do if you pull an apple or something.""

""Well, I'd like to do this song for all of you guys at San Quentin to kind of get back at whoever you want to out there. In my case, I'd like to get back at the fella down in Starkville, Mississippi who still has my $36.""

Well, I left my motel room down at the Starkville Motel
The town had gone to sleep and I was feeling fairly well
I strolled along the sidewalk 'neath the sweet magnolia trees
I was whistling, picking flowers, swaying in the southern breeze

I found myself surrounded, one policeman said, ""That's him
Come along, wild flower child, don't you know that it's two AM
They're bound to get you 'cause they got a curfew
And you go to the Starkville City jail

Well, they threw me in the car and started driving into town
I said: ""What the hell did I do?"" He said: ""Shut up and sit down""
Well, they emptied out my pockets, took my pills and guitar picks
I said: ""Wait, my name is..."" ""Awe shut up."" Well, I sure was in a fix

The sergeant put me in a cell, then he went home for the night
I said: ""Come back here, you so and so; I ain't being treated right
Well, they're bound to get you 'cause they got a curfew
And you go to the Starkville City Jail

I started pacing back and forth, and now and then I'd yell
And kick my forty dollar shoes against the steel floor of my cell
I'd walk awhile and kick awhile, and all night nobody came
Then I sadly remembered that they didn't even take my name
At 8 a.m. they let me out. I said: ""Gimme them things of mine!
They gave me a sneer and a guitar pick, and a yellow dandelion
They're bound to get you 'cause they got a curfew
And you go to the Starkville City Jail

"Death and Hell LyricsShe stepped down from her carriage at 10 Vermillon Street
I took off my roustabout and slung it to her feet
We went into her parlor and she cooled me with her fan
But said i'll go no further with a fantasy makin' man
I said i'd walk on Ponchatrain for what you have today
Just to drink from your deep well and i'll be on my way
She laughed and heaven filled the room said this i give to you
This body's wisdom is the flesh,but here's a thing or two
Death and hell are never full
And neither are the eyes of men
Cats can fly from nine stories high
And pigs can see the wind
She let me make my pallet in the moonlight on the floor
Just outside of paradise but right in hell's back door
The image of her nibbled at the eye of my soul
My dreams were a hurricane and quite out of control
Then her voice came through the storm it's more than flesh ideal
You will have to pay for any wisdom that you steal
I awoke to tinted windows and lavender and red
The first station of the cross is just above my head
I awoke to gargoyles and a hard bench for my bed
Jesus Christ and Pontias Pilate were just above my head
Death and hell are never full
And neither are the eyes of men
Cats can fly from nine stories high
And pigs can see the windEmbed"
"Devil to Pay Lyrics[Verse 1]
Go on girl take your chances
See how long you can go on from man to man
I can read the lines between your stolen glances
And I know it's time to fold this loosing hand
Cause you're drawn to the flame by the thrill and the shame
Of the cheating game they taught you how to play
You've got nothing to lose but your soul girl
And you've only the devil to pay

[Chorus]
You've been flying so high you don't know
That you're blind to the writing on the wall
But some day you'll look down
And you'll find you've got no place to fall
When the bright lights are gone you'll be standing alone
Forsaken in the naked light of day
Then you'll know that it's all over but the dying
And you've still got the devil to pay
[Verse 2]
Join your friends while you got them
Cause you know they're gettin' fewer every day
You can't wait to let them take you to the bottom
And I'm getting tired of standing in your way
But when you hit the ground don't come looking around
For the pieces of the love you threw away
That's the price of the high life you're living
And you still got the devil to pay

"When It’s Springtime in Alaska (It’s Forty Below) Lyrics[Verse]
I mushed from Port Barrol through a blizzard of snow
Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks, the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon
When I walked in the door, the music was clear
Prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below
It was red headed Luie that was singing so sweet
I reached down and took the snow packs off of my feet
I reached for the gal that was singing the tune
We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon
Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug
We did our dance on a Kodiak rug
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below
Well, I was as innocent as I could be
I didn't know that Luie was big Ed's wife to be
He took out his knife and he gave it a throw
When it's springtime in Alaska, I'll be six feet belowEmbed"
"The Ballad of Boot Hill Lyrics[Intro]
(Spoken)
One day in 1881, the Tombstone Epitaph, a booming newspaper in a booming silver mining town, screamed out the headlines about a fight at the O.K. Corral, right down town. The headlines read ""Murder in the Streets of Tombstone."" Well, that wasn’t such hot news, but more stark and spine-chilling than that was the sight on the boardwalk in front of the epitaph building. Neatly laid out in beautiful caskets were the bodies of Tom McLaury, Frank McLaury, and young Billy Clanton, 28 years old. A witness at the trial later said that he saw Doc Holiday blast away with a nickel-plated pistol and Billy Clanton screamed, “Don’t shoot me! I don‘t want to fight.” Today there’s no more silver mining in Tombstone, but up there on Boot Hill, you can see where the graves of the men are. The ones who fought over or because of that big silver strike that created Tombstone

(Sung)
Here lies Les Moore
Four slugs from a .44
No Les no more

[Verse]
Out in Arizona just south of Tucson
Where tumbleweeds tumble in search of a home
There's a town they call Tombstone where the brave never cry
They live by a sixgun by a sixgun they die
It's been a long time now since the town was a boom
The jailhouse is empty so's the Palace Saloon
Just one look will tell you that this town was real
A secluded old dirt road leads up to Boot Hill
Walk up to the fence there and look at the view
That's where they were hanging eighteen eighty two
It's easy to see where the brave men have died
Rope marks on the oak tree are now petrified
At night when the moon shines so far away
It gets mighty lonesome looking down on their graves
There lies Billy Clanton never wanted to kill
But he's there with the guilty way up on Boot Hill (Boot Hill)1Embed"
"San Quentin #2 (live) LyricsI was thinking about you guy yesterday
I've been here three times before, and
I think I understand a little bit how you feel about some things
It's none of my business how you feel about some other things
And I don't give a damn about how you feel about some of the things
But anyways
I try to put myself in your place
And I believe this is the way that I would feel about San Quentin
San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
You've hosted me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen 'em die
And long ago I stopped askin' why
San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and have scarred me through and thru
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man;
Mister Congressman, you can't understand

San Quentin, what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bent my heart and mind and you warp my soul;
And you stone walls turn my blood a little cold
San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall down and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good
San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
Thank you very much

Hey, before we do it, if uh
Any of the guards are still speaking to me, could I have a glass of water?Embed"

"They’re All the Same Lyrics[Verse]
I've drank wine with winos in the alleys dim I've sipped wine with kings
I've seen wino's harlots making love to them I've seen kings with queens
But I find there is no difference to me they are all the same
Except their name for they all need wine and they all need love
To me they are all the same
I've seen the need for just one drink cause the tears to fall from the winos' eyes
I've seen the need for love make a kingdom fall even rich men cry
But I find there is no difference to me they are all the same except their name
For they all need wine and they all need love
To me they're all the same
I watched the weeds grow higher on a pauper's grave where the wino lies
I saw a grave attended by a hundred slaves even rich men die
But I find there is no difference to me they are all the same except their name
For they all need wine and they all need love

"Here Was a Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
(Joy to the world, the Lord is come)
Here was a man, a man
Who was born in a small village
The son of a peasant woman
He grew up in another small village
Until he reached the age of thirty
He worked as a carpenter

[Verse 2]
Then for three years
He was a traveling minister
But he never traveled more
Than two hundred miles from
Where he was born and
Where he did go he usually walked
[Verse 4]
He never held political office
He never wrote a book
Never bought a home
Never had a family
He never went to college
And he never set foot inside a big city

Yes, here was a man

[Verse 5]
Though he never did one on the things
Usually associated with greatness
He had no credentials but himself
He had nothing to do with this world
Except through the divine purpose
That brought him to this world

[Verse 6]
While he was still a young man
The tide of popular opinion turned against him
Most of his friends ran away
One of them denied him
One of them betrayed him
And turned him over to his enemies
Then he went through the mockery of a trial
[Verse 7]
And was nailed to a cross between two thieves
And even while he was dying
His executioners gambled
For the only piece of property
That he had in this world
And that was his robe his purple robe

[Verse 8]
When he was dead
He was taken down from the cross
And laid in a borrowed grave
Provided by compassionate friends
More than nineteen centuries have come and gone
And today he's a centerpiece of the human race
Our leader in the column to human destiny

[Verse 9]
I think, I'm well within the mark when I say
That all of the armies that ever marched
All of the navies that ever sailed the seas
All of the legislative bodies that ever sat
And all of the kings that ever reigned
All of them put together have not affected
The life of man on this earth
So powerfully as that one solitary life

Goodbye Reverend - took you away before you sang your song
Hmmhmmmm hmhmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Some people stick pretty close to home
Some people are born with the urge to roam
Welcome welcome to our town
Hope nobody tries to gun you down
Goodbye Bobby - six white horses come to take you home
Goodbye Robert - took you away before you sang your song

Hmmhmmmm

Goodbye John goodbye Martin goodbye Bobby
Took you away before you sang your song

"The Caretaker Lyrics[Verse 1]
I live in the cemetery
'Old Caretaker' they call me
In the wintertime I rake the leaves
And in the summer I cut the weeds
When a funeral comes
The people cry and pray
They bury their dead
Then they all go away
But through their grief
I can still see
Their hate and greed and jealousy
So here I work
And I somehow hide
From a world that rushes
By outside
But each night
When I rest my head
I'm contented
As the peaceful dead
[Chorus]
But who's going to cry
When old John dies?
Who's going to cry
When old John dies?

[Verse 2]
Once I was a young man
Dashing with the girls
Now no one wants an old man
When I lost my handsome curls
But I want to say
When my time comes
Lay me facing
The rising sun
Put me in a corner
Where I buried my pup
Tell the preacher to pray
Then cover me up
Don't lay flowers
Where my head should be
Maybe God would
Let some grow for me
And all the little children
That I love like my own
Will they be sorry
That Old John's gone?
[Chorus]
But who's going to cry
When old John dies?
Who's going to cry
When old John dies?Embed"
"The Vanishing Race Lyrics[Verse]
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
Oh wagon trains rolling along they fade from my visions and in time will be gone
I see an eagle in space my people will follow oh oh a vanishing race
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
An Indian brave rolled along one day on a lonely mountain trail
And he gazed below with a heart of woe where the prairie schooners sail
A vision formed like a mortal storm in the dust of the wagon train
A vanishing race appeared in space and he sang his sad refrain
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
Oh wagon trains rolling along
Oh now great spirits on high please spare them the sorrow you show to my eye oh oh
Now my blankets are roll and I ride to the valley of the brave Navajo oh oh

And I ride to the valley of the brave Navajo oh oh
Oh oh a vanishing Navajo oh the vanishing Navajo

"City Of New Orleans Lyrics[Verse 1]
Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
15 cars and 15 restless riders
Three conductors, 25 sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey the train pulls out of Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passing graves that have no name, freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of rusted automobiles

[Chorus]
Good morning America, how are you?
Don't you know me? I'm your native son!
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done
[Verse 2]
Dealing cards with the old men in the club car
Penny a point, no one is keeping  a score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels grumbling underneath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep, rocking to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Night time on the City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Halfway home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea
But all the towns & people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still have not heard the news
The conductor sings his song again
""The passengers will please refrain:
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues

[Chorus][x2]Embed"
"Don’t Make Me Go Lyrics[Verse]
You take my hand and smile at me but I can tell you'd rather be
Alone or with somebody else you know
And when your eyes look into mine, that old time love light doesn't shine
But let me try again, don't make me go

[Chorus]
I want you, don't make me go, my heart would break I'd miss you so
Trading love for sympathy is old to me
What's this lovesick heart to do when it cries for only you
Hold me close I love you so, don't make me go

[Verse]
I'm sorry that I never knew the way to show my love for you
I took too much for granted all the time
Two hearts in love must give and take, when one heart fails, the other breaks
Don't make me go, I want to show this love of mine
[Chorus]
I want you, don't make me go, my heart would break I'd miss you so
Trading love for sympathy is old to me
What's this lovesick heart to do when it cries for only you
Hold me close I love you so, don't make me goEmbed"
"The Evening Train Lyrics[Verse]
I heard the laughter at the depot
But my tears fell like the rain
When I saw them place that long white casket
In the baggage coach of the evening train
The baby's eyes are red from weeping
Its little heart is filled with pain
Oh Daddy cried they are taking Mama
Away from us on the evening train
As I turned to walk away from the depot
It seemed I heard her call my name
Take care of my baby and tell him darling
That I'm going home on the evening train
I pray that God will give me courage
To carry on until we meet again
It's hard to know she's gone forever
They're carrying her home on the evening trainEmbed"
"The Big Battle Lyrics[Verse]
I think sir the battle is over, and the young soldier lay down his gun
I'm tired of running for cover, I'm certain the battle is done
For see over there where we fought them, it's quiet for they've all gone away
All left is the dead and the dying, the blue lying long side the grave
So you think the battle is over, and you even lay down your gun
You carelessly rise from your cover, for you think the battle is done
Now boy hit the dirt, listen to me, for I'm still the one in command
Get flat on the ground here beside me, and lay your heart to the sand
Can you hear the deafening rumble, can you feel the trembling ground
It's not just the horses and wagons that make such a deafening sound
For every shot fired had an echo and every man killed wanted life
There lies your friend Jim McKinney, can you take the news to his wife?
No son the battle's not over, the battle has only begun
The rest of the battle will cover the part that has blackened the sun
The fight yet to come is not with cannon, nor will the fight be hand-to-hand
No one will regroup the forces, no charge will a general command
The battle will rage in the bosom of mother and sweetheart and wife
Brother and sister and daughter will grieve for the rest of their lives
Now go ahead, rise from your cover, be thankful that God let you live
Go fight the rest of the battle for those who gave all they could give
I see sir the battle's not over, the battle has only begun
The rest of the battle will cover this part that has blackened the sun
For though there's no sound of the cannon and though there's no smoke in the sky
I'm dropping the gun and the saber and ready for battle am IEmbed"
"Happiness Is You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Way down the mountain I chased a moonbeam
On the beach I built sand castles too
My moonbeams faded my castles tumbled
All of this was meaningless cause happiness is you

[Chorus]
No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are
My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you

[Verse 2]
I tried to doubt you and live without you
Tried to deny but I love you like a do
But I realize now and I'll admit it
You'll always be a part of me because happiness is you

I got no place to call my home no more

Got no cause to hang around
What difference does it make which way I go
Got an empty feelin' deep inside
Still I need to stay alive
And who can tell what waits beyond this road

"I Don’t Know Where I’m Bound Lyrics""I have to sit down for - okay, we'll do that for you, just a minute, thank you. This young man here at San Quentin tonight that wrote a song that I just saw written down on paper the first time yesterday. He sent me the sheet music on it, and I don't know anybody who reads music, except maybe Helen. And I liked the lyrics so much I started singing my own tune to it, you know, the first thing that came to my mind. Let's try a little bit of it, right here...""

I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm bound
Whistle's calling me away, leaving at the break of day
And I don't know where I'm bound

Can't stand locks, bars or doors
Mean cops, insanity, and wars
Gotta find a place of peace
Until then, my traveling won't cease
But I don't know where I'm bound

There's got to be a place for me
Under some green growing tree
Clear cool water running by
An unfettered view of the sky
But I don't know where I'm bound
When I die, don't bury me
'Cause then I must be free
Cremate my body with a grin
Throw my ashes to the wind
'Cause I don't know where I'm bound

I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm bound
Whistle's calling me away, leaving at the break of day
And I don't know where I'm bound

Got myself a little gal
She has been a downright pal
That old highway's calling me
And free I got to be
But I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm boundEmbed"
"If We Never Meet Again This Side of Heaven Lyrics[Verse]
Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
Until we gather in heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore
If we never meet again this side of heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the river of life
Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separation come no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore
Oh so often we are parted with sorrow
And action often quietens our pain
But we never shall sorrow in heaven
God be with you until we meet againEmbed"
"Would You Recognize Jesus LyricsIf you've never fed the hungry, or given clothes to the poor
If you've never helped the stranger who came knocking on your door
If you forgot to send some flowers to sick and shut-in friend
Well if you ain't helping none of these, then you ain't helping Him
If you've ever seen some children, playing ball behind a school
If you've ever watched an old man, plowing ground behind mule
If you've ever stopped and listened, when you could not hear a sound
Then brother you have met Him, because Jesus gets around
Would you recognise Jesus if you met Him face to face?
Or would you wonder if He's just another one you could not place?
You may not find Him coming in a chariot of the Lord, Jesus could be riding in a ""49 Ford
You can find Him in your Momma's eyes, or in your Daddy's face
You can find He's always there to help you win the human race
You can find Him in the mountains, downtown, or by the sea
And brother, here's hoping someone can find him, and you and me
Would you recognise Jesus if you met Him face to face?
Or would you wonder if He's just another one you could not place?
You may not find Him coming in a chariot of the Lord, Jesus could be riding in a ""49 Ford
Would you recognise Jesus if you met Him face to face?

"It Was Jesus Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well a man walked down by Galilee
So the holy book does say
And a great multitude was gathered there
Without a thing to eat for days
Up stepped a little boy with the basket
""Please take this, Lord"", he said
And with just a five loaves and two little fishes
Five thousand had fish and bread

[Chorus]
Who was it everybody[x3]
It was Jesus Christ, our Lord

[Verse 2]
Now pay close attention little children
It's somebody you ought to know
It's all about a man that walked on earth
Nearly two thousand years ago
Well he healed the sick and afflicted
And he raised them from the dead
Then they nailed him on an old rugged cross
And put thorns on his head
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well they took him down and they buried him
And after the third day
When they came to his tomb where they knew he was gone
Because the stone was rolled away
He's not here for he is risen
The angel of the Lord then said
And when they saw him walking with these nail-scared hands
They knew he came back from the dead

"Dinosaur Song Lyrics[Verse]
Dinosaurs lived a long time ago
They were terrible lizards, don't you know?
Some ate plants and some ate meat
Some ate fish and some ate beasts
One was called Diplodocus
One was bigger than your school bus
One was called a Triceratops
Three horns to stop anything that hops
Now can't you just see yourself walking along
Leading your pet Trachadon or feeding your Brontosaurus Rex?
Or scratching your Diplodocus neck
Or riding on a Stegosaurus back or swimming in a Brachiosaurus track
Oh what a time and oh what a fun
Play and tag with your Iguanodon
And if we had dinosaurs
Now could they get along with a horse and a cow?
Well, I wish they hadn't become extinct
Dinosaurs would be nice pets and friends
To have around to run outside
And play with everyday, don't you think?Embed"
"It Takes One to Know Me LyricsIt's true that I used to be crazy
And harder to love than most men
And the blood that ran in these tired hands
Was harder and wilder back then
And I don't feel as tall as I used to
Maybe it's just that I've grown
You're the one that held my hand when I fell
If I just couldn't make it alone

We've lived out all the stories
Sang all the old songs
It takes one to know me
I guess you're the one

Your daughters are ladies of fortune
And your son an heir to the throne
And though this crown that I hold is
Tarnished and cold
It's a symbol of all that we own
Sometimes I wish I was younger
And could pick up the pieces and run
But then I look back on the matter of fact
And it's a race that we've already won
We've lived out all the stories
Sang all the old songs
It takes one to know me
I guess you're the one

We've lived out all the stories
Sang all the old songs
It takes one to know me
And you knew the oneEmbed"

"All of God’s Children Ain’t Free Lyrics[Verse]
I'd sing more about moral of this land but all God's children aren't free
I'd open up every door I can because all God's children aren't free

And he held out his hand to me all God's children aren't free
I'd sing along too a silly song but all God's children aren't free
I'm going to sing the blues for the men they done wrong

From a soldier who'd been wounded in the fray
""I am dying, Captain, dying and I pray before I go
You will give your promise here I pass away""

Do not ask me dear to linger, for I know not what to say
When duty calls, just sweetheart's name in vain
I hope your heart will not be crying, if I'm not among the dying
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again

Yes, when the roses bloom again, beside the river
And the Robin Redbreast sings it's sweet refrain
As in days of Old Lang Syne, I'll be with you sweetheart mine
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again

Do not ask me dear to linger, for I know not what to say
When duty calls, just sweetheart's name in vain
I hope your heart will not be crying if I not among the dying
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again
When the roses bloom again beside the river

"Frankie’s Man, Johnny Lyrics[Verse]
Well now, Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
They were true as a blue, blue sky
He was a long-legged guitar picker with a wicked wandering eye
But he was her man nearly all of the time
Well, Johnny he packed up to leave her, but he promised he'd be back
He said he had a little picking to do a little farther down the track
He said, ""I'm your man, I wouldn't do you wrong""
Well, Frankie curled up on the sofa, thinking about her man
Far away the couples were dancing to the music of his band
He was Frankie's man, he wadn't doing  her wrong
Then, in the front door walked a redhead, Johnny saw her right away
She came down by the bandstand to watch him while he played
He was Frankie's man, but she was far away
He sang every song to the redhead, she smiled back at him
Then he came and sat at her table where the lights were low and dim
What Frankie didn't know wouldn't hurt her none
Then the redhead jumped up and slapped him, she slapped him a time or two
She said, ""I'm Frankie's sister and I was checking up on you
If you're her man you better treat her right""
[Outro]
Well, the moral of this story is be good but carry a stick
Sometimes it looks like a guitar picker just can't tell what to pick
He was Frankie's man and he still ain't done her wrong1Embed"

What do I care just as long as you were mine a little while?
When the road was long and weary you gave me a few good mile
What do I care if I miss a goal because I make a slip?
I'll still be satisfied because I tasted your sweet lips

What do I care if I never have much money?
And sometimes my table looks a little bare
Anything that I may miss is made up for each time we kiss
You love me and I love you, so what do I care?

Well I used to hang out down at the VFW hall
And stare at the photographs up on the wall
Of the neighborhood boys that died in the wars we've been through
And the hand lettered sign that said remember Jimmy McGrew
Well Jimmy went to Nam back in 1965
But there's a lot of men here that think Jimmy McGrew's still alive
Though they carved his name on a stone in Washington DC
His brother said, that stone doesn't prove a thing to me

It's veteran's day and the skies are gray
Leave the uniforms home because there isn't going to be a parade
But we'll fill up a glass for the ones that didn't make it through
And leave a light in the window tonight for Jimmy McGrew

Jesus said seek the first the kingdom of God and his righteousness
And all these things shall be added unto you

And time of troubles what to depend upon to be the truth and help us carry on

And I'm not giving you the run a round
I'd much rather be dead than have to beg my daily bread
And to pay my way no matter where I'm bound; bum! bum! bum!
Well, I didn't really think that I did wrong
So long as I stayed here where I belong
I did the only thing I could
Same as anybody would
And I was simply trying to get along

"The Man on the Hill Lyrics[Verse]
Will we get cold and hungry
Will times be very bad?
When we are needing bread and meat
Where are we going to get it, Dad?
We'll get it from the man
In the house on the hill
Yes we will from the man on the hill
Ploughing time is over
Still the fields are bare
How we going to make a living
With twenty acres to share?
I'll beg for more land
From the man on the hill
Yes I will, I'll ask the man on the hill
I haven't got no Sunday shoes
That I can wear to town
Papa reckon the boss has got
A pair of hand-me-downs
I'll go and ask the man
In the house on the hill
Yes I will, I'll ask the man on the hill
Maybe he will help us
Maybe we'll get by
But who's going to pay the dying bills
If we all should die
We'll leave it to the man
In the sky when we die
Yes we'll leave it to the man in the skyEmbed"
"Monteagle Mountain Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a stretch of Highway on Interstate 24 between Nashville and Chattanooga
That's claimed many trucker's life
And your life is in your hands when you start down that long steep grade
On Monteagle Mountain
I just rolled out of Nashville in my big rig heading south
My eyes are on fire feels like cotton in my mouth
My whole body's aching but I got to make them big wheels roll
I got to be in Florida by tomorrow morning with a full heavy load
I got to get past Atlanta as soon as I can tonight
I got to try to dodge the scales and stay out of Smoky's sight
But there's one big thing standing like a nightmare in my way
I got to top Monteagle Mountain a little bit later today

[Chorus]
Going down Monteagle Mountain on I-24
It's hell for a trucker when the devil's at your door
He'll tempt you and tell you come on let her roll
Because the mountain wants your rig and trucker, I want your soul
[Verse 2]
When I started down Monteagle the brakes just wouldn't hold
I knew I was in trouble and about to lose control
The runaway ramp was waiting I saw the warning sign
I said Lord help me make it, have mercy on this soul of mine
Well I ploughed into that runaway ramp and I could feel that big truck groan
My life flashed right before my eyes and for a minute I thought I was gone
But when the smoke cleared I thanked God that I was still alive
Because when there's a runaway on Monteagle some truckers don't survive

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah many a good man had lost his life on Monteagle Mountain it's a long steep grade
Many good hard working boys have gone over the side, watch out for MonteagleEmbed"
"Come Along and Ride This Train Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know a land where mountain streams are running free
I know a prairie where there’s miles between each tree
I know where there’s people you would like to get to know
Come along with me and go

[Chorus]
Come along and ride this train
Come along and ride this train
Cross the mountains prairies reservations
Rivers levees plains

"Pickin’ Time Lyrics[Verse]
I got cotton in the bottom land
It's up and growing and I got a good stand
My good wife and them kids of mine
Gonna get new shoes, come Picking Time
Get new shoes come Picking Time
Every night when I go to bed
I thank the Lord that my kids are fed
They live on beans eight days and nine
But I get them fat come Picking Time
Get them fat come come Picking Time
The corn is yellow and the beans are high
The sun is hot in the summer sky
The work is hard til laying by
Laying by until Picking Time
Laying by until Picking Time
It's hard to see by the coal-oil light
And I turn it off purty early at night
Because a jug of coal-oil costs a dime
But I stay up late come Picking Time
Stay up late come Picking Time
My old wagon barely gets me to town
I patched the wheels and I watered them down
Keep her in shape so she'll be fine
To haul my cotton come Picking Time
Haul my cotton come Picking Time
Last Sunday morning when they passed the hat
It was still nearly empty back where I sat
But the preacher smiled and said that's fine
The Lord'll wait until Picking Time
The Lord'll wait until Picking TimeEmbed"
"One and One Makes Two Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh the number one is not my favorite number
Because one means only me and there's no you
But one plus one you see makes two that's you and me
And it's more fun when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one makes two at least I'm pretty sure they do
Oh yes it's true one and one makes two

[Chorus]
Now let me show you what I mean
Now you say you want to play upon a seesaw
You're all alone and you don't know what to do
Well just go and find a friend and sit him on the other end
You'll have more fun when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one
[Chorus]
Now you say you want to play a game of baseball
And you look around and there's no one but you
Well just find someone you know and he will catch the ball you throw
You'll have more fun when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one

[Verse 2]
Now there's the best reason of all that I like to number two right here
Now everyone needs somebody to share with
To love and help and care for through and through
And there's no one that I've known who can share or love alone
It's a lot nicer when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one
I said it's true one and one makes twoEmbed"
"Casey’s Last Ride Lyrics[Verse]
Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following the footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speaking to a soul
The poisoned air he's breathing has the dirty smell of dying
Because it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clicking of the turnstile and the rattle of his chain

""Oh,"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you""
""Here,"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile""
""See,"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you""
""Lord,"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while""

Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for anything they can to keep from going home
Standing in the corner, Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye
""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me""
""Now,"" she said, ""now that you've a family of your own""
""Still,"" she said, ""it's so blessed good to feel your body""
""Lord,"" she said, ""Casey it's a shame to be alone!""Embed"

"From Sea to Shining Sea Lyrics[Verse]
The beautiful spacious skies, the amber waves of grain
To the majestic purple mountains above the fruited plain
God did shed His grace from sea to shining sea on you and on me
From Sleepy Hollow mountain country to the swamps of Okefenokee
To Guthrie Oklahoma, to Hibbing Minnesota
To Grants Pass Oregon, to Stone Pipe Wells, California
From Texas to Montana, from California to Maine
In the sunny days the winter snow from Arizona sand
To Cherokee North Carolina, to Tarpen Springs Florida
America, it's time to be refreshed, recalled to memory
God did shed His grace on Thee from sea to shining sea
The land is big the best is free
Sand and surf grass and tree from sea to shining sea
God shed His grace on me
And crown Thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining seaEmbed"
"Gentle on My Mind LyricsIt's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mindEmbed"
"Casey Jones Lyrics[Verse]
Come all you rounders if you want to hear the story about a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the roller's name on a 68 wheeler course he won his fame
Caller called Casey about half past four he kissed his wife at the station door
He climbed in the cabin with his orders in his hand
Said this is the trip to the Promised Land
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin Casey Jones orders in his hand
Casey Jones leaning out the window taking a trip to the Promised Land
Through South Memphis Yards on a fly rain been a falling and the water was high
Everybody knew by the engine's moan that the man at the throttle was Casey Jones
Well Jones said fireman now don't you fret Sam Webb said we are not a giving up yet
We are eight hours late with the southbound mail
We'll be on time or we are leaving the rails
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Dead on the rail was a passenger train blood was a boiling in Casey's brain
Casey said hey now look out ahead jump Sam jump or we'll all be dead
With a hand on a whistle and a hand on a brake north Mississippi was wide awake
I see railroad official said he's a good engineer to be a laying dead
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Headaches and heartaches and all kinds of pain all the part of a railroad train
Sweat and toil the good and the grand part of the life of a railroad man
Casey Jones climbed in the cabinEmbed"
"Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream Lyrics[Chorus]
Last night I had the strangest dream I've ever known before
I dreamed that all the world agreed to put an end to war

[Verse]
I dreamed I saw a mighty room, the room was filled with men
And the papers they were signing said they'd never fight again
And when the papers were all signed, and a million copies made
They all shook hands and bowed their heads and grateful prayers were prayed
And the people in the streets below were dancing round and round
While swords and guns and uniforms lay scattered on the ground

Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around Heaven all day

Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around Heaven all day

Dear Lord above, can't you know I'm pining
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining
Lift me to paradise

Show me that river, take me across

"Christmas As I Knew It Lyrics[Verse]
One day near Christmas when I was just a child
Mama called us together and mama tried to smile
She said you know the cotton crop hadn't been too good this year
There's not a lot of spending money and well at least we're all here
I hope you won't expect a lot of Christmas presents
Just be thankful that there is plenty to eat
That'll make things a little more pleasant
And us kids got to thinking how really blessed we were
At least we were all healthy and most of all we had her
Roy cut down a pine oak tree and we drug it home Jack and me
Daddy killed a squirrel and Louise made the bread
Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings before we went to bed
Mama and daddy sacrificed because this Christmas was kind of lean
After all there was the babies Tom and Joanne
And babies need a few things
I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack
And though we disagreed now and then
When I gave Jack that whistle he knew I thought the world of him
Mama made the girl's dresses out of flower sacks
And when she ironed them down
You couldn't tell that they hadn't come from town
A sharecropper family across the road didn't have it as good as us
They didn't even have a light and it was way past dusk
And mama said, Well I bet they don't even have coal oil
Let alone apples and oranges and such
Me and Jack took a jar of coal oil nd some hickernuts we'd found
We walked to the sharecropper's porch and set them down
A poor old ragged lady eased open the door
She picked up the coal oil and hickernuts and said
""I sure do thank you"" and quickly closed the door
We started back home me and Jack
And about halfway we stopped looked back
And in the sharecropper's window at last was a light
So for one of the neighbors and for us it was a good Christmas night
Christmas came and Christmas went
Christmas that year was heaven sent
And my daddy put on his rubber boots
And paced the floor waiting for the thaw
Back home in Dyess ArkansasEmbed"
"God’s Hands Lyrics[Verse 1][Johnny Cash]
Yesterday when I came home, I was just about ready to scream
My work’s been driving me crazy and the bills are burying me
The weight of the world was on me, I was sinking like a stone
But I have come to realize I can’t do it on my own

[Chorus][Johnny and Carter Family]
I’m going to put it into God’s hands, start living on God’s plans
Going to do the best I can, that’s all I can do
I’m going to put away my doubts, somehow it’ll all work out
And I can rest easy now that I've put it into God’s hands

[Verse 2][Johnny Cash]
My mamma always told me you can’t live by bread alone
You've got to have faith in the good Lord’s grace and keep on keeping on
Accept the things that you can’t change and change the things you can
And if you ever catch yourself worrying just put it into God’s hands

Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us

Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine

It leaves our home so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year

"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
Virgil Caine is the name, and I served on the Danville Train
Until Stonemason cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
By May the tenth, Richmond had fell, it's a time I remember, oh so well

The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the people were singing they went
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Back with my wife in Tennessee, when one day she called to me

Now I don't mind chopping wood, and I don't care if the money's no good
You take what you need and you leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

[Verse 3]
Like my father before me, I will work the land
Like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave, but a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeatEmbed"
"Wide Open Road Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, you said you had enough
You said that you were leaving
I said, shove off honey, baby, I ain't grieving
Pack your bags and pull out this evening
There's a wide open road
Early this morning you where nowhere about
And so I searched the town but you had done pulled out
I looked North, East and West and then a leading South
I saw a wide open road

[Chorus]
There's a wide open road
It's leading South from my abode
If you stick around and turn your temper down
There's a wide open road
[Verse 2]
Well, the reason I was looking for you all over town
Was to tell you that your kitty cat was still around
And you left your wedding ring when you went down
That wide open road
If you going to stay away then honey let me know
How to cook hot biscuits, how to roll a dough
Every thing's gone crazy since I told you to go
Down the wide open road

There's a wide open road
And baby I want you to know
You can look down south or you can turn back home
There's a wide open roadEmbed"
"No Charge Lyrics[Verse 1]
Our little boy came up to his mama in the kitchen this evening
While she was fixing supper
And he handed her a piece of paper he'd been writing on
And after wiping her hands on her apron she read it and this is what it said
For mowing the yard 5 dollars
For making my own bed this week 1 dollar
For going to the store 50 cents
For playing with my little brother while you went shopping 25 cents
For taking out the trash 1 dollar
For getting a good report card 5 dollars
And for raking the yard 2 dollars
Total amount owed 14 dollars and 75 cents
Well as mama looked at him standing there expectantly
And I could see the memories flashing through her mind
And so she picked up the pen and turning the paper over
This is what she wrote and I read it to him
[Chorus]
For the nine months she carried you growing inside her no charge
For the nights we sat up with you doctoring you praying for you no charge
For the time and the tears that you've caused through the years there's no charge
When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge
For the nights filled with dread and the worries ahead no charge
For advice and for knowledge and the cost of your college no charge
For the toys food and clothes and for wiping your nose there's no charge
When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge

[Verse 2]
Well when I finished reading he had big tears in his eyes
And he looked up at his mother and he said mama I sure do love you
Then he took the pen and in great big letter he wrote Paid In Full

When you added all up the cost of real love is no chargeEmbed"

There's a blizzard coming on and I'm wishing I was home
For my pony's lame and he can't hardly stand
Lord my hands feel like their froze and there's a numb that's in my toes
But it's only seven miles to Maryanne
It's only seven miles to MaryAnne
You can bet we're on her mind for it's nearly suppertime
And I know that there's hot biscuits in the pan
Listen to that norther sigh if we don't get home we'll die
But it's only five more miles to Maryanne
It's only five more miles to MaryAnne
That wind's howling and it seems mighty like a women's scream
And we'd best be moving faster, if we can
Dan, just think about that barn with that hay so soft and warm
It's only three more miles to Maryanne[x2]
Come on Dan get up, you honory cuss or you'll be the death of us
I'm so weary but I'll help you, if I can
All right, Dan, perhaps it's best we'll just stop a while and rest
For it's still another mile to Maryanne
It's still another mile to MaryAnne

Late that night the storm was gone and they found him there at dawn
He'd made it but he couln't leave old Dan
Yes, they found him on the plains his hands frozen to the reigns
He was just a hundred yards from Maryanne
He was just a hundred yards from MaryAnne3Embed"
"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth goodwill to men
I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along unbroken song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men
And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong that mocks the song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

[Chorus]
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doubt He sleeps
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth goodwill to men

Until ringing singing on its way
The world revolve from night to day
A voice a chime a chance so blind
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

My baby left me just the other day
I guess the things will never be the same
But I must forget that she is gone
Because time goes by and life goes on

Making plans, shaking hands
Try to prove that I'm a man
It's hard to do but I must try
Because life goes on and so will I

It's been kind of tough these last few days
Trying to act normal and be gay
It's not easy to be all alone
But time goes by and life goes on
If I see her anywhere
I hope she thinks that I don't care
For after night there comes the dawn
Yes time goes by and life goes onEmbed"
"Mr. Garfield Lyrics[Verse]
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Me and my brother was down close to the depot when I heard the report of a pistol
My brother run out and come back in all excited
And I said what was it and he said it was the report of a pistol and then he said
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Lord I knew the President was supposed to be at the depot that day
And we just would't believe that he's shot
But we'd run over there and there was so many folks around
That we couldn't see him but some lady was standin' there crying
And I said m'am what was it that happened m'am and she said
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Well everybody drifted off toward home finally
And they looked like they felt about as bad as I did
But in a few weeks I heard that the President was still alive
And I told my brother I said let's get on that train and go to where he's laid up hurt
Well when we got to his big house up there I asked the fellow
I said who was it that did it who was it that shoot the President
And he said it was Charlie Guiteau that shoot Mr. Garfield and I said
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man good man
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man low
I heard some fellow there that had been in the house to see the President
And I sidled up him to listen to what he was telling and he said
Mrs Lucretia Garfield was always at his side
In the heat of the day fanning him when he was hot
He said that just that day the President said to Mrs Lucretia
He said Crete honey (he called her Crete)
Said if somethin' worse happens to me after awhile you get yourself a good man
And Mrs Lucretia said James (she called him James)
She said I won't hear to that now she said I love you too much but he said
You'll make some good man a good wife good wife
You'll make some man a good good good wife
(Don't pull in single harness all your life good gal
Don't pull in single harness all your life)
That's what he said don't pull in single harness all your life
Well a few days later I come back to where the President was resting
And it seems everybody was crying
The flag was hanging halfway up to the flagpole in front of the house
And everybody looked so sad and I asked a soldier boy there
And I said is is is Mr. Garfield and he said yeah he's gone
Going to lay him in that cold lonesome ground down low
Going to lay him in that cold lonesome ground
Well they laid the President by that long cold branch Mr. Garfield's been laid down low
Mr. Garfield has been shot dow Mr. Garfield's been shot

"Route No. 1, Box 144 Lyrics[Verse]
His dying barely made the morning paper
And they summed it up in twenty words or more
Killed in action leaves wife and baby
At Route 1 Box 144
He grew up on a little farm just a couple of miles out of town
As a boy he worked in his daddy's field
And when his daddy could spare him
He hired out to the neighbors
For whatever they could pay him
He was thought of as just average a good boy
Nothing more the average amount of friends
He married his high school sweetheart
They brought a little plot of ground
Couple of miles out of town on a mailbox it said
Route 1 Box 144
Well back in town there were very few people that really knew him
Because he hardly ever came to town
Except for maybe on Saturdays of course the usual crew was always there
But he didn't spent a lot of times with the usual crew
He took care of his business
Bought what he had to have or could afford for his family
And went back to his little farm
With a baby on the way he went to the army and it was a short while
That the news came that he was killed in action
His body was sent back on a plane and then by train
And then they brought the body from the train station
To Route 1 Box 144
[Outro]
He never did great things to be remembered
He'd never been away from home before
But you'd've thought that he was president or something
At Route 1 Box 144Embed"
"Blowin’ in the Wind LyricsHow many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must the white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?

Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they are forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?

Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?

Yes, and how many deaths will it take 'til he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the windEmbed"
"Sweet Betsy from Pike Lyrics[Intro]
(Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei)

[Verse]
Oh, do you remember sweet Betsy from Pike
She crossed the big mountains with her lover Ike
With two yoke of oxen and a big yellow dog
And a tall Shanghai rooster and one spottled hog
Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei
They soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out
And down in the sand she lay rolling about
While Ike in great tears looked on in surprise
Saying Betsy get up you'll get sand in your eyes
Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei
Betsy got up in the great deal of pain
She said she'd go back to Pike County again
But I gave a sigh then he fondly embraced
And he traveled along with his arm round her waist
(How can sweet Betsy went out to the dance
And Ike poor a fellow he's down at his pance)
Betsy was dressed up in ribbons and rings
Said Iken you're an angel but where are your wings
Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei
Well, the miner said Betsy will you dance with me
She answeres I will if you want make two free
I can't dance too hard do you want to know why
Because I'm so full of that strong out cooli
Ike and sweet Betsy got married of course
But Ike was so jealous he gotta divorce
And Betsy well satidfied said with a shout
Goodbye forever I'm glad you've backed out

"Kneeling Drunkards Plea Lyrics[Chorus]
""Lord, have mercy on me""
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in Heaven looked down

[Verse 1]
I went down by an old country church
I saw the drunkard stagger and lurch
And as he reached his mother's grave
I saw that drunkard kneel and pray

[Chorus]
""Lord, have mercy on me""
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in Heaven looked down
[Verse 2]
""Bring my darling boy to me""
Was his mother's dying plea
And as he staggered through the gate
Alas, he came just one day too late
Three years have passed since she went away
Her son is sleeping beside her today
And I know that in Heaven his mother he'll see
For God has heard that drunkard's plea

[Chorus]
""Lord, have mercy on me""
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in Heaven looked down
I know that God in Heaven looked downEmbed"
"Ringing the Bells for Jim Lyrics[Verse 1]
The father heard church bells at midnight
A wrong time for church bells to chime
He went to the tower, found a little girl there
Said, Why ring the bells at this time?

[Chorus]
I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm crying but my brother Jim is dying
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim

[Verse 2]
Please father, pray for him this Christmas
He's sick and he's in so much pain
The doctors all say, he'll be gone any day
So, I must ring the bells again

On the day after Christmas
She brought him said, Father, heed little Jim
You see, he got well, when he heard the church bells
I was ringing the bells for Jim

"Look For Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look for me there in the morning
When the clay of worthless ground
Is baked into the brick to build the church
That doesn't mind to wait with patience till it's found

[Chorus]
He said children look for me look for me
Look for me late in the evening when the honey bear is lost
And hears a buzz of honey bees that leads him on and feeds him
Till his hunger feels at home he said children look for me look for me

[Verse 2]
Look for me look for me love will be there beside you
Love will be there to guide you look for me
He said help me to help you to help yourself to me
He said children look for love look for me
[Verse 3]
Look for me there in the hand
That drops a penny in the cup
And in the hand that lends its strength
To help the lonely through the night and lift the beggar up

[Chorus]
He said children look for me look for me
Look for me there in the chill of dawn and in the newborn eyes
Of a baby left discarded by a girl who could offer nothing more
Than a small back alley prayer he said children look for me look for me

[Verse 4]
Look for me look for me love will be there beside you
Love will be there to guide you look for me
He said help me to help you to help yourself to me
He said children look for love look for meEmbed"
"Just the Other Side of Nowhere LyricsI come from just the other side of nowhere
To this big time lonesome town
They got a lot of ice and snow here
Half as cold as all the people I've found
Every way I try to go here
Somebody is always trying to bring me down
I've seen about enough to know where I belong

I've got a mind to see the headlights shining
On that old white line between my heart and home
Sick of spendin' sundays wishing they were mondays
Sittin' in a park alone
Give my best to anyone who's left who ever done me
Any lovin' way but wrong
And tell 'em that the pride of just the other side o nowhere's
Goin' home
Takin' nothin' back to show there
For these dues that I've paid
But the soul I almost sold here
And the body I've been givin' away
Fadin' from the neon nighttime glow here
Headin' for the light of day
Just the other side of nowhere, goin' home

I've got a mind to see the headlights shinin'
On that old white line between my heart and home
Sick of spendin' sundays wishin' they were mondays
Sittin' in a park alone
Give my best to anyone who's left who ever done me
Any lovin' way but wrong
And tell them that the pride of just the other side of nowhere's
Goin' home
Just the other side on nowhere, goin' homeEmbed"
"Jacob Green LyricsJacob Green got busted for possession
Next morning early he appeared in court
But he was sent to jail to wait to be trialed at some later date
Next morning early, there came a sad report

At the jail they took away his clothes to shame him
And to make sure Jacob Green had no pride left
They cut of all his hair today they found him hanging there
Afraid to face the day he killed himself

It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen

It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
Jacob's father hired a team of lawyers
Inspections and long inquiries were held
The sheriff then retired and the papers said two guards were fired
They put a brand new coat of paint on Jacob's cell

But like a tomb that looks so white and shiny
Inside you'll find corruption never seen
And somewhere out there tonight in a dirty cell without a light
There will be locked up another Jacob Green

It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen

It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got doneEmbed"
"After All Lyrics[Verse 1]
We have drifted apart
Broken hearts, me and you
After all of this time
I'm satisfied inside to know
This memory that I had
It's more good than bad
You taught me how to sing
And bring you love

[Chorus]
After all this time
You're still a friend of mine
So I believe in someone
After all
[Verse 2]
Our love didn't last long
What went wrong?
Who's to say?
If you never been by
How then could I
Begin to say

After all this time
You're still a friend of mine
So I believe in someone
After all
After all this time
You're still a friend of mine
So I believe in someone

"Farmer’s Almanac Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, the farmer prayed for a better year
And the crops were good, for the Lord did hear
But, his barn burned down with winter near
The Answer came in white and black
In the Farmers' Almanac, it says
If a man can have half his wishes, he can double his trouble
A sweet old lady was 84
When her kinfolks came for a month, or more
Now, from overwork, she's on the other shore
Much too late, she said, Now you all come back
And, it says in the Farmers' Almanac
Visitors, and fish, smell after 3 days
Our leader was a silver tongued man
He deceived the people of the land
And when he got caught
He couldn't stand
It's a little of beat, and a little off track
But, it says in the Farmers' Almanac
In rivers and bad government, the lightest things float to the top
Rod said, I don't believe in God
Rod died, and now he lays beneath the sod
For God did not believe in Rod
Life is a trouble and a weary track
But, it says in the Farmers' Almanac
Feed your faith, and your doubts will starve to death
The little boy followed the honey bee
And it went straight to the honey's tree
He got stung, but got the honey free
Consolation for the things you lack
Is in the Farmers' Almanac
It also says
God gave us the darkness, so we can see the stars
He came home, three hours late, from work
He said, I had a flat, and I fell in the dirt
She said, Well, you have lipstick on your shirt
Well, it turned out like Jill and Jack
And, it says in the Farmers' Almanac
Lies have to be covered up, Truth can run around naked
He said, Honey, you know I'm true. I just look at other women, that's all I do
Then, she caught him with her best friend, Peggy Sue
Sometimes, some women DO look back
And it says in the Farmers' Almanac
There is a LOT of difference, between shopping and shoplifting
I sat down at a shoeshine stand
I had a very slow shoe-shine man
I said, You sure don't pop that rag, like some of them can
He looked at me, and answered right back
It says in the Farmers' Almanac
The trouble with the world today, is there is too much 'popping' and not enough 'shining
My father's father was the wisest man I ever knew
Sixty years of education
Seven years of school
Farming kept his body strong
At night the only books he owned
Kept his mind sharp as a tack
The family bible and the Farmers' almanac
[Chorus]
When to plant
When to harvest
How you weed, just what you sow
When to look for rain, and who to turn to when it don't
There was a plan for early frost
Salvation for the lost
Words to live and die by front to back
The family bible and the Farmers' Almanac

[Verse 2]
One came from his mother
Handed down the day she died
The co-op sent the other
Every year at Christmas time
He knew the seasons to the day
Knew Paul and Peter by first name
He could answer any question he was asked
With the family bible and the Farmers' Almanac

[Chorus]

[Outro]
He knew the way to get
Through this life, and to the next
While others spoke of faith
He found the facts
In the family bible and the farmers' almanac

"Call Your Mother Lyrics[Chorus]
When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And thank her for the good years that we had
Gently break the news that you don't love me
And give my best regards to your good old dad

[Verse 1]
I always liked your family
We got along just splendidly
Though your brother
Kind of rubbed me the wrong way
I remember that your eyes turned green
When they crowned your sister County Queen
Though she couldn't hold a candle
To your beauty any day

When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And thank her for the good years that we had
Gently break the news that you don't love me
And give my best regards to your good old dad

[Verse 2]
Back when we could laugh and play
On family reunion day
Didn't we all look funny
In our 1950's clothes
Your daddy wore that greasy stuff
Your brother drank more than enough
Your mom wore penny loafers
With runners in her 'hose

[Chorus]
When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And thank her for the good years that we had
Gently break the news that you don't love me
And give my best regards to your good old dad
When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And give my best regards to your good old dadEmbed"

I think about her almost all the time

"These Hands Lyrics[Verse]
These hands aren't the hands of a gentleman
These hands are calloused and old
These hands raised a family, these hands built a home
Now these hands raised to praise the Lord
These hands won the heart of my loved one
And with hers they were never alone
If these hands filled their task then what more could you ask
For these fingers have worked to the bone
Now don't try to judge me by what you'd like me be
For my life hasn't been a success
Some people have power but still they grieve
While these hands brought me happiness
Now I'm tired and I'm old and I haven't much gold
Maybe things ain't been all that I planned
Lord above hear my plea when it's time to judge me
Take a look at these hard working hands

Take a look at these hard working handsEmbed"

We never really got right down to talking, we couldn't seem to find the place or time
Distance in the miles between us made us kinda stranger
And it added to the distance already there between our minds
And Cindy I love you, yes, I love you, yes, I love you
And when I can't think of anything to say
Don't be reading something in my mind that isn't there

[Chorus]
Remember Cindy, I love you anyway

[Verse 2]
I look at you and wonder what you're thinking
I'm sure you felt the same, a time or two
We must both remember that true love sure costs us nothing
You just told me your affection and I owed the same to you
And Cindy I love you

"Texas, 1947 Lyrics[Intro]
Being six years old I had seen some trains before
So it's hard to figure out what I'm at the depot for

[Verse 1]
Trains are big and black and smoking steam screaming at the wheels
Bigger and anything there is least that's the way she feels
Trains are big and black and smoking louder July 4th
But everybody's acting like this might be something more
Than just picking up the mail or the soldiers from the war
Something even old man Wyman's never seen before
And it's late afternoon on a hot Texas day
Something strange was going on and we are all in the way
There are fifty or sixty people just setting on their cars
And the ole men left their dominoes and come down from the bars
And everybody's checking old Jack Kittrell checks his watch
And us kids put our ears to the rails to hear them pop
So we already know it when they finally said train time
You'd have thought that Judgment Day was rolling down the line
Because things got real quiet and mama jerked me back
But not before I get the chance to lay a nickel on the track
[Chorus]
Look out here she comes she's coming look out there she goes she's gone
Screaming straight through Texas like a mad dog cyclone
Big and red and silver she don't lay no smoke
She's a fast rolling streamline come to show the folks
I said look out here she comes she's coming look out there she goes she's gone
Screaming straight through Texas like a mad dog cyclone

[Verse 2]
Lord she never even stopped
She left fifty or sixty people still setting on their cars
Wondering what it's coming to and how it got this far
And me I got a nickel smashed flatter than a dime
By a mad dog runaway red silver streamline train

"Without Love Lyrics[Verse]
Without love, I am half human
Without love, I'm all machine
Without love, there's nothing doing
I will die without love
Without love, I am an island all by myself in a heartbreak sea
Without love, there's no denying I am dying without love
For there is nowhere I can run and there is no hiding place
Sticking out like a sore thumb by that gloomy look upon my face
Without love, I'm incomplete
Without love, I am not whole
Without love, I'm barely on my feet
I am dying without love

For there is nowhere I can run

Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set set me free oh lonesome me
A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
I thought of everything from A to Z oh lonesome me
I'll bet she's not like me she's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
Well there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues

She stole my winter's food supply and something else I fear
My saving’s in the mattress have strangely disappeared
Now those who know me best knows he who robs me best beware Allegheny
I'm going to call up the dogs and hunt you down drag you back here by the hair

Oh Allegheny something tells me you're dis-satisfied
Well could it be because I've been your mail-order bride
There's a half of you that's French yeah and I need to crave a better style
And a half of you is Cherokee yeah and I've gone wild Allegheny

She's got a head start on me as a crow flies half a day
And unless I miss my guess she'll stop to rest in Monterey
But if I take the Knoxville Highway thirteen hours it will be Allegheny
Well she forgot I knew the shortcut I'll be there in less than three

[Chorus]
Oh Allegheny something tells me

[Verse 3]
I signaled for my dogs to wait outside the hotel door
I described her to the desk clerk he said try the second floor
And then he mentioned she's got company
And that marks the stranger’s doom Allegheny

Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me

"One More Ride Lyrics[Verse 1]
I long for the trip don't need no grip I'm taking one more ride
Way out there in the prairie air I guess it's in my hide
Oh the clickety clack of the railroad track is calling
If a man could know where the Santa Fe goes when she gets under steam
And the big loud bell that bongs farewell to hear her whistle scream
She's bound to go where there ain't no snow a falling

[Chorus]
One more ride[x2]

[Verse 2]
I miss the gloom of the prairie moon that seemed to know my name
And the tumbleweed where the prairie dog feed I miss them just the same
They're all a part of a song of heart I'm saying
I recall the tune that I sang to the moon and it seemed to make it smile
And I rode away at the close of day and I stayed so long awhile
But I long to be where the memory is ringing
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
As the years go by I wonder why I longed to leave my home
And to hit the trail of the iron rail away out there alone
But my heart would sigh till I know that I am leaving
If I don't come back on a one way track way down from Mexico
You could find me there or any old where that a tumbleweed will grow
It's a goodbye now you'll never know how I'm grieving

"Crazy Old Soldier LyricsI've had fame and fortune
Women come knock on my door
I've lived to the limit
And maybe a little bit more

There are so many stories
Of how I got out of control
Some say it's a woman
Some say it's my troubled soul

I'm like a crazy old soldier
Fighting a war all my own
Just me and the whiskey
And the bottles are ten thousand strong

You'd think I'd give up
As many times I've been hit
But like a crazy old soldier
I just dont know when to quit
Barrooms and bedrooms
Are just faces and places and names
Once for the pleasure
And Lord knows, once for the pain

I've tried to forget her
And all of the things that we've done
But as long as there are memories
I'll never hang up my gun

I'm like a crazy old soldier
Fighting a war all my own
Just me and the whiskey
And the bottles are ten thousand strong

As many times I've been hit, never

"Ned Kelly Lyrics[Intro]
In Australia a bandit or an outlaw was called a bushranger
One of Australia's most infamous bushrangers was a man named Ned Kelly

[Verse 1]
Ned Kelly was a wild young bushranger
Out of Victoria he rode with his brother Dan
He loved his people and he loved his freedom
And he loved to ride the wide open land
Ned Kelly was a victim of the changes
That came when his land was a sprout and seed
And the wrongs he did were multiplied in legend
With young Australia growing like a weed

[Chorus]
Ned Kelly took the blame
Ned Kelly won the fame
Ned Kelly brought the shame
And then Ned Kelly hanged
[Verse 2]
Well he hid out in the bush and in the forest
And he loved to hear the wind blow in the trees
While the men behind the badge were coming for him
Ned said they'll never bring me to my knees
But everything was changed and run in cycles
And Ned knew that his day was at an end
He made a suit of armour out of ploughshares
But Ned was brought down by the trooper's men

"Lost on the Desert LyricsA burning hot sun, a cry for water
Black wings circle the sky
Stumblin' and fallin', somebody's callin'
You're lost on the desert to die

I had to give up and they took me to jail
But I hid all the money I got
Way out on the desert where no one could get it
And I left a mark at the spot
Then I got away and I ran for the desert
The devil had taken control
I needed water but he said I'd make it
Near the money is a big waterhole

A burning hot sun, a cry for water
Black wings circle the sky
Stumblin' and fallin', somebody's callin'
You're lost on the desert to die
Just up ahead is where I left my mark
Or it may be to the left or the right
I've been running all day and they'll catch up tomorrow
I've got to find it tonight
Then up jumped the devil and ran away laughing
He drank all the waterholes dry
He moved my mark 'til I'm running in circles
And lost on the desert to die

A burning hot sun, a cry for water
Black wings circle the sky
Stumblin' and fallin', somebody's callin'
You're lost on the desert to die

Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal

Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew
Danger is double and pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that, that I've seen in my day
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine

And a pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner digging my bones
Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew
Danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mineEmbed"
"Johnny 99 LyricsWell they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late last month
Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none
He came home too drunk from mixin' Tanqueray and wine
He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call'm Johnny 99

Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop
Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top
When an off-duty cop snuck up on him from behind
Out in front of the Club Tip Top, they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99

Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was Mean John Brown
He came into the courtroom and stared poor Johnny down
Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime
Prison for ninety-eight and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 99
A fistfight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away
His mama stood up and shouted ""Judge don't take my boy this way""
Well, son, you got any statement you'd like to make
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away
Now judge, judge I had debts no honest man could pay
The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they were gonna take my house away
Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man
But it was more 'n all this that put that gun in my hand

Well, your honour, I do believe I'd be better off dead
So if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head
Then sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time
And let them shave off my hair and burn Johnny 99Embed"

But she had waited nearly all her life
Just one more trip to town to tell the boys goodbye
Then he'd be back to take her for his wife

Then rode to town to celebrate his plan
He told them this would be his last carousing

When Cody had to face a jealous man ""
Another story goes that no one really knows
But it seems there was a dance hall girl called Nan

We do know that the shot or two was heard from some back room
Then there was a silence in the place
Just one more trip to town but all his chips were down
They found Cody lying on his face

Because Cody won't be riding back this time

It was in the town of Griffin, the year was eighty three
It was there an old cow puncher, stepped up and said to me
How do you do young fellow and how would you like to go
And spend a pleasant summer, out in New Mexico
I'll furnish you good wages, your transportation too
If you will but go with me, one summer season through
But if you should get homesick and back to Griffin go
Then I'll furnish you no horses from the hills of Mexico
We left the town of Griffin in the merry month of May
When all the world was lovely and everything was gay
With saddles on our horses, marching over we did go
Until we reached the logging out in New Mexico
It was there our pleasures ended and our troubles they began
The first hail storm fell on us, those cattle how they ran
Through all the thorns and thistles, us cowboys had to go
While the Indians watched upon us, out in New Mexico
Well, when the drive was over, the riders would not pay
To all you happy people, this much I have to say
Go back to your friends and loved ones, tell others not to go
To the God forsaken country, they call New MexicoEmbed"
"Transfusion Blues Lyrics[Verse]
Early one morning while making the rounds
Took a transfusion and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head

Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a transfusion and away I run
Made a good run, but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico

Laid in the hot joint, taking the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, ""Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty heck that shot your woman down""
Said, ""Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant, just read it to me""
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more

When I was arrested, I was dressed in black
Put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried-up carcass in that county jail

Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by 12 honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commenced to look about

In about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
Verdict read ""in the first degree""
I hollered, ""Lordy, Lordy, have mercy on me!""

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the San Quentin pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot my woman down

Come all you gotta listen unto me
Lay off that liquor and let that transfusion beEmbed"
"I Talk to Jesus Every Day Lyrics[Verse]
Well you talk about important people that you say you know
Presidents and superstars of big television shows
Well I know someone personally who's bigger than them all
And next to him your superstars look mighty small
And I have a talk with him each day and he's interested in every word I say
No secretary ever tells me he's been called away I talk to Jesus every day
Well now I don't think that I'll ever be in any Hall of Fame
And the social register of wealthy folks might drop my name
But my name is written in the book of life I'm proud to say
And that's all that really matters anyway
And I talk to Jesus every day and he's interested in every word I say
No secretary ever tells me he's been called away I talk to Jesus every day
I talk to Jesus every dayEmbed"
"You’re So Close to Me Lyrics[Chorus]
You're so close to me your body and your soul are now a part of me
We are one now, no one could ever know just what you are to me
You're so close to me your deepest, darkest secrets all belong to me
I am you, you are me, you're so close to me

[Verse 1]
And in the morning I can look into your eyes and know your feelings
We can talk to one another without speaking
And if it's loving that you're going to know it
Your sweet eyes show it every morning

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
And in the evening I can feel your gentle softness without touching you
I don't need another thing I've got so much in you
And if it's loving that you're going to give it
I'm going to live it every evening

"He’s Alive LyricsThe gates and doors were barred
And all the windows fastened down
I spent the night in sleeplessness
And jumped at every sound
Half in hopeless sorrow
And half in fear that day
Would find the soldiers breaking through
And drag us all away

Just before the sunrise
I heard something at the wall
The gate began to rattle
And a voice began to call
I hurried to the window
Looked down into the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldiers feet
But there was no one there but Mary
So I went down to let her in
And John stood there beside me
As she told us where she'd been
""They've moved Him in the night
And none of us knows where
The stone's been rolled away
And now His body isn't there""
(stone's been rolled away and now His body isn't there)

We both ran toward the garden
Then John ran on ahead
We found the stone and empty tomb
Just the way that Mary said
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in
Was just an empty shell
And how or where they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell

Something strange had happened there
Just what I did not know
John believed a miracle
But I just turned to go
Circumstance and speculation
Couldn't lift me very high
I had seen them crucify Him
And I saw Him die
Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything I had promised Him
Just added to my shame
When at last it came to choice
I had denied I knew His name
And even if He were alive
I know it wouldn't be the same

Suddenly the air was filled
With a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from everywhere
Drove shadows from the room
And Jesus stood before me
With His arms held open wide
I fell down on my knees
And I clung to Him and cried
(Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah)

He raised me to my feet
And as I looked into His eyes
The love was shining out from Him
Like sunlight from the skies
Guilt and my confusion
Disappeared in sweet release
And every fear I ever had
Just melted into peace
[Chorus] x3
He's alive, He's alive
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide

[Outro]
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive, He's aliveEmbed"
"Mary of the Wild Moor Lyrics[Verse]
It was on one cold winter night
When the wind blew across the wild moor
When Mary came wandering home with a child
Till she came to her own father's door
""Father, dear father,"" she cried
""Come down and open the door
Or the child in my arms will perish and die
From the winds that blow across the wild moor.""
But her father was deaf to her cry
Not a sound of a voice did he hear
So the watchdog did howl and the village bells tolled
And the wind blew across the wild moor
Oh, how the old man must have felt
When he came to the door the next morn'
And he found Mary dead but the child still alive
Closely grasping its dead mother's arms
In grief, the old man passed away
And the child, to it's mother, went soon
And no one, they say, lives there to this day
And the cottage, to ruin, has gone
But the villagers point out the spot
Where the willows grew over the door
Saying, ""There Mary died, once the gay village bride
From the wind that blow across the wild moor""Embed"
"Forty Shades of Green Lyrics[Chorus 1]
Green, green, forty shades of green

[Verse 1]
I close my eyes and picture
The emerald of the sea
From the fishing boats at Dingle
To the shores of Donaghadee
I miss the river Shannon
And the folks at Skibbereen
The moorlands and the meddle
With their forty shades of green

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But most of all I miss a girl
In Tipperary town
And most of all I miss her lips
As soft as eiderdown
[Chorus 2]
Again I want to see and do
The things we've done and seen
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar
And there's forty shades of green

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
I wish that I could spend an hour
At Dublin's churching surf
I'd love to watch the farmers
Drain the bogs and spade the turf
To see again the thatching
Of the straw the women glean
I'd walk from Cork to Larne to see
The forty shades of green

"In Garden of Gethsemane Lyrics[Verse 1]
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses

[Chorus]
And he walks with me[x2]
And he tells me I am His own

[Verse 2]
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me
[Chorus]
Within my heart is ringing
And he walks with me[x2]

[Verse 3]
And he tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
I'd stay in the garden with Him
Though the night around me be falling
But He bids me go; through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling

[Outro]
And He walks with me[x2]
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever knownEmbed"
"What Is Man LyricsWhat is man that you are mindful of him, Lord
You made the stars you made the sun
And all the worlds that came to be at your command
What is man? What has he done?

Then you crown him with glory and with honor
Give him dominion over land and sea and air
And store up an inheritance in heaven
O what is man that you would care

What is man that you would let him live at all
To shed the blood of his own kind
And ever fail to even follow where you call
What is man? Why do you mind?

Yet you crown me with glory and with honor
Give me dominion over land and sea and air
And store up my inheritance in heaven
O what is man, that you care?
What is man, Lord, that you would care?Embed"
"If Not for Love Lyrics[Verse]
A broken man moves slowly down the sidewalk
Humbled by the favours he must seek
From those that he encounters on his walk through misery
Who are rich enough to hurt just as they please
If not for love I could be one of these
An old man on a park bench stares with envy
At a couple with their children on their knees
While across the park a young man is caught by the police
Stealing for a habit he must feed
And if not for love I could be one of these

[Chorus]
I could be one of these or so many many more
Always at the beck and call of shame
I'm thankful I was called by love to walk among the happy
But if not for you love wouldn't know my name
[Verse 2]
A man of squander talents vainly calls on
His gift of God now straining through his soul
While in the crowd before him a jealous friend awaits
The moments that he can no longer please
And if not for love I could be one of these

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yes if not for love I could be one of theseEmbed"
"Jesus Was A Carpenter Lyrics[Verse]
Jesus was a carpenter and he worked with a sow and a hammer
And his hands could form a table true enough to stand forever
And he might have spun his life out in the coolness of the mornings
But he put aside his tools and he walked the burning highways
To build a house from folks like you and me
And he found them as they wandered through the wild Judean mountains
And he found them as they pulled their nets upon the Sea of Galilee
And for a thousand evenings while the day behind him emptied
He walked among the poor and he stopped to touch the dying
And he built his house from people just like these
It was on a shining Sunday when he rode to old Jerusalem
And the palms they cast before him were the crimes they laid against him
It was on a storming Friday when he climbed the streets of Calvary
And where he died today why they're sellin' beads and postcards
And they tell us too that that was long ago
But would he stand today upon the sands of California
Or walk the sweating blacktop in New York and Mississippi
Where the mighty churches rise above the screaming cities
Would he be a guest on Sunday a vagrant on a Monday
With the doors locked tight against his kind you know
Come again now Jesus be a carpenter among us
There are chapels in our discontent cathedrals in our sorrows
And we dwell in golden mansions with the sand for our foundations
And the raging water's rising and the thunder's all around us
Won't you come and build a house on rock again
[Outro]
Jesus was a carpenter and he worked with a sow and a hammer
And his hands could form a table true enough to stand forever
And he might have spun his life out in the coolness of the mornings
But he put aside his tools and he walked the burning highways
To build a house from folks like you and me

"You’ve Got a New Light Shining in Your Eyes Lyrics[Verse]
You've got a new light shining in your eyes
And I can see now right where your beauty lies
And it's showing in your face that your heart has found a place
And I can hear it in your whisper and your sighs
You've got a new way of doing things you do
And it's plain to see there's been a change in you
And I wonder could it be that the change is due to me
For I have felt a certain something too

[Chorus][x2]
You've got a way about you now that you never had before
You've got a look you're wearing now like no look you ever wore
I tried to hide it for a while but now I realize
You've got a new light shining in your eyes

Run softly while she sleeps and dreams for a time
Cause she dreams of tomorrow when she'll be my wife

"The Shifting Whispering Sands, Part I Lyrics[Verse]
I discovered the Valley of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
While prospecting in a western state
I saw the silent windmills, the crumbling water tanks
The bones of the cattle picked clean by buzzards
Bleached by the desert sun
I stumbled over a crumbling buck board
Nearly covered by the sand
And stopping to rest I heard a tinkling, whispering sound
And suddenly realized that even though the wind was quiet
The sand did not lie still
I seemed to be surrounded be a mystery
So heavy and apperceive I could scarcely breath
For weeks I wondered aimlessly in the valley
Seeking answers to the many questions that raced through my mind
Where was everyone? Why the white bones? The dry wells?
The barren valley where people must have lived and died
I sat down and buried my face in my hands
And resting I learned the secret of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
How I managed to escape from the valley I don't know
But now to pay my debt for being saved
I must tell you what I learned out on the desert
So many years ago
When the day is oddly quiet
And the breeze seems not to blow
One would think the sun is resting
But you'll find this is not so
It is whispering softly whispering
As it slowly moves along
And for those who stop and listen
It will sing this mournful song
Of sidewinders and the horn toads
On the thorny chaparral
In the sunny days and moonlight lights
The lonely coyotes yell
How the stars seem they can touch you
As you lay and gaze on high
At the heavens where your hoping
You'll be going when you die1Embed"
"These Things Shall Pass Lyrics[Verse 1]
These things shall pass and some great morning
We'll look back and smile at heartaches we have known
So don't forget when shadows gather
The Lord our God is still the King upon His throne

A rose looks gray at midnight but the flame is just asleep
And steel is strong because it knew the hammer and white heat
These things shall pass and life be sweeter
When love and faith are strong they cannot long endure

[Verse 2]
These things shall pass so don't you worry
The darkest time is just one hour before dawn
So hold up high and face your troubles
And don't dispare if you must face them all alone

These things shall passEmbed"

"Let Him Roll Lyrics[Intro]
Let him roll, boys let him roll
I bet he's gone to Dallas rest his soul

[Verse 1]
Now he was a wino, tried and true
Done about everything there is to do
He worked on freighters, he worked in bars
He worked on farms, and he worked on cars
Now it was white port wine, that put that look in his eye
That grown men get when they need to cry
And we sat down on the curb to rest
And his head just fell down on his chest
He said ""every single day it gets
Just a little bit harder to handle and yet
Then he lost the thread and his mind got cluttered
The words just rolled off down the gutter
He was a elevator man in a cheap hotel
In exchange for the rent on a one room cell
And he's years old before his time
No thanks to the world, and the white port wine
So he said ""son"", he always called me son
He said, ""life for you has just begun
And then he told me the story that i heard before
How he fell in love with a Dallas whore
He could cut through the years to the very night
That it all ended, in a whore house fight
And she turned his last proposal down
In favor of being a girl about town
Now it's been seventeen years right in line
And he ain't been straight none of the time
It's too many years of fighting the weather
And too many nights of not being together
So he died
[Chorus]
Let him roll, boys let him roll
I bet he's gone to Dallas rest his soul
Let him roll, boys let him roll
He always thought that heaven
Was just a Dallas whore

[Verse 2]
When they went through his personal affects
In among the stubs from the welfare checks
Was a crumbling picture of a girl in a door
An address in Dallas, and nothing more
Well the welfare people provided the priest
And a couple from the mission down the street
Sang amazing grace, and nobody cried
Accept some lady in black way off to the side
We all left and she's standing there
The black veil covering her silver hair
And one-eyed John said her name was Alice
She used to be a whore in Dallas

Day by day, work or play, ready side by side
Hello friend, come on in, the gate is open wide
Bound to be a fighting free bonanza
Singing pines of boundary lines for the Ponderosa Ranch

The stars at night, the morning light, water in the branch
We ride along four men strong together
Every plain and ridge is our heritage, Ponderosa Ranch

The lilies so pale and the roses so fair
And the myrtle so bright with an emerald hue
The pale amaryllis and violets so blue
I will dance I will sing and my laugh will be gay
I'll cease this wild weeping drive sorrow away
Tho my heart is now breaking, he'll never know
His name made me tremble, my pale cheeks to glow

He told me he loved me and promised to love
Through ill and misfortunes all others above
Now another has won him, oh misery to tell
He left me in silence no word of farewell
He taught me to love him, he called me his flower
That blossomed for him all the brighter each hour
But I awoke from my dreaming, my idol was clay
My visions of love have all faded away
I'll think of him never, I'll be wildly gay
I'll charm every heart and the crowd I will sway
I'll live yet to see him regret the dark hour
He won and neglected the frail wildwood flowerEmbed"

Each giving to the other love and giving it away
We spent the precious time we knew was borrowed
Because you gave me the courage to live with yesterday
And you gave me tomorrow

You brought me a candle to light my way to bed
You erased those shadows I'd been seeing
You brought me a pillow to rest my weary head
You taught me a gentle way of dreaming

"Daddy LyricsHis deeds were never published for the public
The things he did were never done for show
His name was never printed in the paper
Until about two days ago

He only filed a short form for his taxes
No one asked him how he felt about the war
He always had a good word for his neighbor
Now his good words won't be heard anymore

And through the rain I heard the choir singing
""Nearer my God to Thee""
Through the mist I saw some children crying
And I felt nearer my God to Thee

His table was never full of plenty
His silverware was never the real thing
But the tears on the faces of his family
Were just as real as if he were a king
The preacher said he'd always been a good man
But preachers love to throw that phrase around
But the tears I tasted gave his words new meaning
Watching old friends putting daddy in the ground

And through the rain I heard the choir singing
""Nearer my God to Thee""
Through the mist I saw some children crying
And I felt nearer my God to Thee
""Nearer my God to Thee""Embed"
"Are All The Children In Lyrics[Verse]
When I'm alone I often think of an old house on the hill
Of a big yard hedged in roses where we ran and played at will
And when the night time brought us home hushing our merry din
Mother would look around and ask are all the children in
Well it's been many a year now and the old house on the hill
No longer has my mother's care and the yard is still so still
But if I listen I can hear it all no matter how long it's been
I seem to hear my mother ask are all the children in
And I wonder when the curtain falls on that last earthly day
When we say goodbye to all of this to our pain and work and play
When we step across the river where mother so long has been
Will we hear ask her a final time are all the children in (I come)Embed"

But still true

Each night in dreamland we wander along
Telling love stories anew
When from a blue sky a black cloud came rolling
Breaking my heart in two
Oh, we ought not to part

You're the one rose that's left in my heart

Oh, we ought not to part

"Six White Horses LyricsCome here and look through the window Marie
Open up the shutters, tell me what you see?
Was that his knock that I heard at the door
Or is it six white horses coming down the road?
Come here and touch me and say that it's alright
You know that to my eyes the days are as the nights
Read again the letter that tells me where he's gone
To hell with the fighting, I want my son home
I taught him to fish and I taught him to be strong
I taught him that killing any man was wrong
But tomorrow in battle I'd run to where he stood
If the help of a blind man would do any good
Last night I went to his room for awhile
I've touched all the things that he used as a child
I rocked the cradle where he used to lay
I found his tin soldiers and threw them away
Come here and look through the window Marie
Open up the shutters, tell me what you see
Was that his knock that I heard at the door
Or is it six white horses coming up the road?Embed"
"Snow in His Hair Lyrics[Verse 1]
The years have been many, the years have been long
But at last I'm returning to daddy and home
He's looking my way though he hardly can see
God bless my old daddy he recognize me

[Chorus]
There's snow in his hair and I helped to put it there
A halo of worry and care
As my daddy grows old he's more precious than gold
For I cherish the snow in his hair

[Verse 2]
His shoulders were bent with the weight of the years
I scarcely could hold back the flood tide of tears
He walked with a cane as he hurried along
Coming to meet me to welcome me home

"Mother’s Love Lyrics[Verse]
We are in Nazareth within a few feet of this place Jesus lived as a child
With his father Joseph the carpenter and his mother Mary
In Jerusalem the mother of Jesus watched her son die on the cross
She stood by to give him the only thing that she had left a mother's love
It was my mother who first told me of Israel stories of this land
That made it so dear to me that I am draw like a prodigal son to relive these stories
Here's a two thousand year old story that tells of the strength of a mother's love
Once a young man lived with his mother beside a great forest
The young man was in love with a beautiful girl who lived in the forest
He told the girl in the forest that if she would marry him
He would bring her anything that she asked
Knowing that the young man lived with his mother the girl said
Take your dagger and cut out your mother's heart
And bring it to me and I will marry you
Well this made the young man very sad
But he wanted to merry the girl so he killed his mother and cut out her heart
Running through the forest with his mother's heart in his hands
He stumbled and fell and dropped the heart
As he was getting up his mother's heart cried out from the ground
My son did you hurt yourself when you fellEmbed"

I'm just an old chunk of coal
But I'm going to be a diamond some day

"Keep on the Sunny Side LyricsThere's a dark and a troubled side of life
There's a bright and a sunny side too
Though we meet with the darkness and strife
The sunny side we also may view

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten up the way
If we keep on the sunny side of life

Let us greet with a song of hope each day
Though the moments may be cloudy or fair
Let us trust that the Savior always
Will keep us every one in His care

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten up the way
If we keep on the sunny side of life
Oh, the storm and it's fury broke today
Crushing hopes that I cherished so dear
Storms and clouds will in time pass away
And the sun again will shine bright and clear

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten up the way
If we keep on the sunny side of lifeEmbed"
"Heavy Metal (Don’t Mean Rock And Roll To Me) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Somedays I think this old machine is out to get me
Somedays she does what I tell her
It's like dancing with a widow-maker forty hours a week
I'm talking about a big old D-10 caterpillar

[Chorus]
I don't know why I like to drive them like I do
It isn't nothing but a hundred seventy-five thousand pounds of steel
Could be the money babe, could be the power
Could be I love the way it feels
Could be I love the way it feels

[Verse 2]
But you know she's mighty unforgiving then you gotta pay attention
Cause the D-10 can be the death of you
But I get her all fired up and I can feel it in my soul
And it's hard to tell just who's driving who
I can move Alaska all the way to Beirut
I can bulldoze a beeline from here to Peru
I can push the Rocky Mountains into the sea
You know Heavy metal don't mean rock and roll to me
I'm like a modern day mule skinner driving ten thousand mules
So I say a little prayer every day
Lord just let me get her turned around
Without falling off this mountain
You know the boss man don't like me treating his D-10 that way

Troublesome waters much blacker than night
Are hiding from view of the harbor's bright lights
Tossed in the turmoil of life's stormy sea I cry to my Saviour have mercy on me
Then gently I'm feeling the touch of his hands guiding my boat in safely to land
Leading the way to heaven's bright shore
Troublesome waters I'm fearing no more
Troublesome waters around me do roll they're rocking my boat and racking my soul
Loved ones are drifting and living in sin the treacherous whirlpools are pulling them in
Then gently I'm feeling
When troublesome waters are rolling so high I'll lift up my voice and to heaven I'll cry
My Lord I am trusting give guidance to me and steady my boat on life's troubled sea

"Luther Played The Boogie Lyrics[Verse: Johnny Cash]
We were just a plain ol' hillbilly band
With a plain ol' country style
We never played the kind of songs
That'd drive anybody wild
Played a railroad song with a stomping beat
We played a blues song kinda slow and sweet
But the thing that knocked them off of their feet was
Ooh-wee

When Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie

Luther played the boogie
In the strangest kind of way
Play it strange!
Well, we did our best to entertain
Everywhere we'd go
We'd nearly wear our fingers off
To give the folks a show
Played jumping jive to make them get in the groove
We played sad songs, real slow and smooth
But the only thing that'd make them move was
Ooh-wee

"The Ballad of Annie Palmer Lyrics[Spoken Word Intro]
One time I went down to Jamaica, to a place called Rose Hall Plantation. They grow a lot of sugarcane and tomatoes and things at Rose Hall now. It used to be just a sugarcane plantation back in the days of slavery. And they tell stories about the place and about the great house at Rose Hall, that many, many years ago, there came from the country of Haiti a lady named Annie Palmer who lived in that great house there. And she was the mistress of the plantation. She was the boss. Her word was law. Well, they tell a lot of tales about Annie. They say she had three husbands, one at a time, I guess. But they also tell tales about Annie and the slaves. There were about 5,000 slaves on the plantation. She had her favorites and she had the ones that weren't her favorites. Well, down on the sea, there are three tall palm trees waving in the breeze, and they say that maybe Annie Palmer's three husbands are buried under those palm trees...

[Verse 1]
On the island of Jamaica, quite a long long time ago
At Rose Hall Plantation, where the ocean breezes blow
Lived a girl named Annie Palmer, the mistress of the place
And the slaves all lived in fear to see a frown on Annie's face

[Chorus]
Where’s your husband Annie, where's number two and three?
Are they sleeping beneath the palms beside the Caribbean sea?
At night I hear you riding and I hear your lovers call
And I still can feel your presence round the great house at Rose Hall

[Verse 2]
Well if you should ever go to see the great house at Rose Hall
There's expensive chairs and china and great paintings on the wall
They'll show you Annie's sitting room and the whipping post outside
But they won't let you see the room where Annie's husbands died
[Chorus]
Where’s your husband Annie, where's number two and three?
Are they sleeping beneath the palms beside the Caribbean sea?
At night I hear you riding and I hear your lovers call
And I still can feel your presence round the great house at Rose HallEmbed"
"Papa Was a Good Man LyricsIt rained all the way to Cincinnati
With our mattress on top of the car
Us kids were eatin' crackers and baloney
And papa kept on driving never stopped once at a bar
Then mama started talking about Jesus
And how our lives could be from now on
While papa bought a used tire in Columbus
Mama rocked the baby till all her tears were gone

She said your papa is a good man and don't you kids forget it
The whiskey's tryin' to ruin him but I know the Lord won't let it
Then we sang Amazing Grace and Bringing In The Sheaves
Rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me

I remember when papa finally gave up drinking
I think mama was the only one on earth that really thought he could
I remember all the times we'd packed everything we owned
Into some old car and started out for some new town
And through it all mama's faith was the one thing
That was strong enough to finally do the some good
She said your papa is a good man and don't you kids forget it
The whiskey's tryin' to ruin him but I know the Lord won't let it
Then we sang Amazing Grace and Bringing In The Sheaves

And it shook me right out of my sleep

"The Hobo Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
There was a time when lonely men would wander
Through this land rolling aimlessly along
So many times I've heard of their sad story
Written in the words of dead men's song
Down through the years many men have yearned for freedom
Some found it only on the open road
So many tears of blood have fell around us
Cause you can't always do what you were told

[Chorus]
Please tell me where have all the hobos gone to
I see no fire burning down by the rusty railroad tracks
Could it be that time has gone and left them
Tied up in life's eternal traveling sack

Last Sunday night I wrote a letter to my loved one
I signed my name and I knew that I stayed away way too long
There was a time when my heart was free to wander
And I remember as I sing this hobo song

"Any Old Wind That Blows Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lord, she's restless
Like cotton candy clouds that sail the day
Slow an' free
And she possesses
A mind that can't resign itself to stay
For long with me
Thought I've tried and tried to keep her tied and satisfied
Until she really needs me
Yes I do
But when that certain look comes on her face
I can't replace it, and she leaves me

[Chorus]
She's a butterfly in mid July
Who just can't wait to try her brand new wings
On brand new things
And she needs no rhyme or reason, when she goes
Her mind is on what lies beyond that wall of blue horizon
I suppose
And heaven knows
She'll go sailing off on any old wind that blows
Yes she will, yes she will
She'll go sailing off on any old wind that blows
[Verse 2]
I know she needs me
About as much as I need someone else
Which I don't
And if need be
I swear someday I'll up and leave myself
Which I won't
Even if she loved another man, I'd understand it more than I do
Mmm
But I know the only reason
That she ever had for leaving, is she wants to

[Chorus]
She's a butterfly in mid July
Who just can't wait to try her brand new wings
On brand new things
And she needs no rhyme or reason, when she goes
Her mind is on what lies beyond that wall of blue horizon
I suppose
And heaven knows
She'll go sailing off on any old wind that blows
Yes she will, yes she will
She'll go sailing off on any old wind that blows2Embed"
"The Man Comes Around (early take) LyricsThere's a man going around taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There will be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around

The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup?
Or disappear into the potter's ground?
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

'Til Armageddon, no salam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet, they'll cast the golden crowns
When the man comes around

Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
In measured hundredweight and penny pound

I hear the train a comin'
It's rollin' 'round the bend
I ain't seen the sunshine
Since, I don't know when
Lord, I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
And time keeps draggin' on
And that train keeps a-rollin'
On down to San...

Let's give her a big hand, June Carter

I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine

I went down, down, down

Well when I was just a baby
My Mama told me, ""Son
That I want you to be a good boy
I don't want you to play with guns,""
But I shot a man in Reno
I shot him just to watch him die, Lord he dead
Now that train keeps rollin'
I hang my head down and cry

Johnny Yuma was a rebel
He roamed through the west
And Johnny Yuma, the rebel
He wandered alone

He got fightin' mad
This rebel lad
He packed no star
As he wandered far
Where the only law
Was a hook and a draw
The rebel, Johnny Yuma
I want to thank you, for being so good to us
I'd like to say a special hello to all the men here in the prison
That are not with us tonight
That they couldn't, find a key to the door or something
They couldn't let a bunch of them out here
I wish everyone of you could have been out here with us
All you guys
I understand they're piping the show into your cells or somewhere
That's supposed to be listening, or maybe
It's not closed circuit television that you have in here is it?
Anyway, hello to all you fellas who can't be here
We wish you could have all been here
We have had a ball, have we not?

Well, if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little
Farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison
That's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle
Blow my blues away

Well the sprinftime is coming and the honeybees are humming
And I just saw a robin flying by
While your wedding bells are ringing my poor heart is singing
The story of a broken heart hmm the story of a broken heart
When the trees start to blooding the memories start to flooding
And my heart takes a trip to yesterday
When we walked neath the moon an our love was in bloom
Now we're two lovers drifted apart hmm the story of a broken heart

Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
Until we gather in heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore
If we never meet again this side of heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the river of life
Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separation come no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore
Oh so often we are parted with sorrow
And action often quietens our pain
But we never shall sorrow in heaven
God be with you untill we meet againEmbed"

Nasty Dan was a nasty man
Hard to understand that Nasty Dan

Now Nasty Dan was a nasty man the whole day long
He'd go where he could he'd try real good to make things go wrong
He'd jump for joy when a little boy would trip and fall
And the only words that he ever said were, ""I don't like you at all!""

Now a real interesting thing that I want you to know about is this here
Because it's the most important thing it concerns a girl and things like that
Now Nasty Pearl was a nasty girl that met Dan somehow
She said you like me rotten as can be let's get married now
So they went and they did and had a nasty kid
And I must confess that Dan pretty much leaves everyone alone now
And he doesn't bother anybody anymore cause he just lives in his nasty old house
With his nasty old wife and his nasty od kid in nasty happiness

Have you had misty eyes for years?
Could that mist be tears? Could that mist be tears?Embed"
"My Treasure Lyrics[Verse]
I saved a lot of money my fortune was untold
And like a fool I idealized my silver and my gold
My earthly treasure's mounted but when I counted through
I realized the treasure I had overlooked was you
My treasure unmeasured but forsaken of the treasures that come from above
My treasure unmeasured but it don't hold a heart of the one that I love
If I had my life before me if I could see it all
I'd stake my claim on things that are secured against downfall
I'd work for earthly treasures like any man would do
But I set my sights much higher and I'd be sure that I had you
My treasure unmeasured unmeasuredEmbed"
"Time Changes Everything LyricsTime has passed, I've forgotten
Mother Nature does wonderful things
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you
But time changes everything

You can change the name of an old song
Rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you
But time changes everything

Goodbye, good luck, may God bless you
I don't say I won't love again
I guess that it's true for me and for you
That time changes everythingEmbed"
"Rock of Ages Lyrics[Verse]
Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee
Let the water and the blood from Thy wounded side which fload
Thee of sin the double cure save from raft and make me pure
Let me hime myself in Thee
In my hand no prize I bring simply to Thy cross I cling
While I draw this pleading breath when my eyes shall close in death
Lord when I rise to world unknown and behold the on Thy throne
Rock of ages cleft for me let me hime myself in Thee
Let me hime myself in TheeEmbed"
"Over The Next Hill (We’ll Be Home) LyricsBy the way the land is layin'
I think I'd be safe in sayin'
That over the next hill we'll be home

It's a straight and narrow highway
No detours and no byways
And over the next hill we'll be home

From the prophets I've been hearin'
I would say the end is nearin'
For I see familiar landmarks all along

By the dreams that I've been dreamin'
There will come a great redeemin'
And over the next hill we'll be home
By the speed that we'd been makin'
I would say there's no mistakin'
That over the next hill we'll be home

There's a place that we are nearin'
That so many have been fearin'
And over the next hill we'll be home

When we get there we're all hopin'
That we'll find the gate is open
And there'll be a refuge from the comin' storm

For the way's been long and weary
But at last the end is nearin'
And over the next hill we'll be home1Embed"
"I’m Going To Memphis LyricsBring a drink of water Leroy bring a drink of water (no)

Oh lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home

When life's toils are ended
And parting days have come
Sin no more will tempt me
There from thee I'll roam

"Girl In Saskatoon Lyrics[Verse]
I left a little town
A little south of Hudson Bay
I couldn't find a thing, to make a rounder want to stay
I fought the wind across the baren waste in the crystal doom
Going for to marry the girl in Saskatoon
I'm glad I realized that no one could take her place
My heart was beating for her like the winter beat my face
But knowing that I'd see her made my spirit bright as June
I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon
South and West and following the cold December sun
I bedded down in the Carragana when my daily trek was done
Then up and pressing onward by the light of the morning moon
A prodical returning to the girl in Saskatoon
Then I found the trail that had packed beneath the snow
I made the final miles where the prairie lillies grow
The steeple on a church glistened by the prairie moon
I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon
[Outro]
My journey was forgotten
When I held her in my arms
My wonderlust was stiffled
By possesion of her charms
And even beneath the steeple
Where we couldn't wait till June
I found eternal spring with the girl in SaskatoonEmbed"
"The Mystery Of Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
Peterbilt drivers don't pick up low riders
They don't slow for the curves in the road
They hate to keep logs, they hate riders on hogs
Watch out for a shift in your load

[Chorus]
When I was young, I had Gene Autry guns
But I never had a Lionel train
Now I've got a truck, if I keep payments up
And it weighs thirty tons in the rain

[Verse 2]
I wear Frisco jeans with riveted seams
My money is chained to my belt
I wear a Cat cap just like my pap
He drove till it ruined his health
Now, Georgia Bill Smith wore thick glasses and boots
He could see about as far as he could walk
He came up too fast on that bridge overpass
Lord, the preacher sure gave a fine talk
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've read a few lines from the poets
And sometimes, I might cross the line
I don't know the answer to the mystery of life
But a woman sure helps pass the time

"My Shoes Keep Walking Back to You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I may say that I don't care, hold my head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through, my heartaches start anew
And that's when I miss you most of all

[Chorus]
And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you

[Verse 2]
No matter how much I pretend I wish I had you back again
Because nothing else means half as much as you
My world just seemed to die the day you left my side
And I can't forget no matter what I do

And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to youEmbed"

(Worried man) (Papa is a worried man)
(Worried man) (Papa is a worried man)

[Verse 1]
The place I go to draw my pay
Closed the door on me today
Told me just to stay away
And don't come back again
Ah: I told my Mama: Baby, don't you cry
I'll get a job before the day go by

"Oh, What A Dream Lyrics[Verse 1]
I dreamed I walked in a field of flowers
Oh, what a dream
The houses all were silver towers
Oh, what a dream
Beside the road an angel sat
I said hello and tipped my hat
And stopped when I saw her smile
And set me down a while
I set me down a while
You dreamer you
I tried the angel for a kiss
Oh, what a dream
But she turned away and my lips missed
Oh, what a dream
She said, ""Sir, I'll have you know
I met you just a while ago
You're welcome for to sit
But calm yourself a bit, sir
Calm yourself a bit
You dreamer you
I fell in love like one, two, three
Oh, what a dream
I asked the angel to marry me
Oh, what a dream
She said, ""Sir, I can't marry you
But I'm a dream that can come true
There are dreams of much my worth
That live upon the earth, sir
Live upon the earth
You dreamer you""
Then I awoke and found my love
Oh, what a dream
As heavenly as the one above
Oh, what a dream
We'll marry in a sea of flowers
Home will be a silver tower
There'll be heaven in my life
With an angel for a wife[x2]

"Gone Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
She is deliciously tall sort of a long girl
She is delightfully small sort of a song girl
She freely admits to the world that she was a wrong girl
That's nothing compare to the fact that she is a gone girl

[Chorus]
Gone like a knock on the door, gone with yesterday and before
Gone with the wind for ever more

[Verse 2]
She'd never laid claim to the fact that she was a strong girl
So why should I loudly proclaim that she was a wrong girl
I'd rather think of her name as some sort of song girl
And think poetical things to think of my gone girl
[Chorus]
Gone like a knock on the door, gone with yesterday and before
Gone with the wind for ever moreEmbed"
"All I Do Is Drive Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I asked an old truck driver
About life out on the road
If he does a lot of singing
When he's bringing in his load
If there's a pretty waitress crying for him
Every hundred miles
If he gets a lot of loving
If he has a lot of smiles
And I asked him if those trucking songs
Tell about a life like his
He said, if you want to know the truth about it
Here's the way it is

[Pre-Chorus]
All I do is drive, drive, drive
Try to stay alive
And keep my mind on my load
Keep my eye upon the road
[Chorus]
I got nothing in common with any man
Who's home every day at five
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive

[Verse 2]
Well, we shared a cup of coffee
Then I had to warm it up
And his greasy fingers trembled
As he held onto the cup
And I said, don't you hear a lot of music
See a lot of sights
But if you'll tune into the Grand Ole Opry
Saturday night
I will dedicate you a trucking song
To which you can relate
He said, you just do the singing
And I'll do the driving mate

If I can get the fuel

"I Call Him Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, the blue's still in the water and the blue's still in the sky
And way beyond the blue there's someone watching from on high
My clothes may be ragged and my shoes may be worn
But I've been a wealthy boy since I've been born

Because I call Him when I'm troubled and I call Him when I'm weak
And He always pulls me through my troubles some way and I believe
He'll be there
(He'll be there)
He'll be there

Like He always is to answer when I call Him

My mother used to tell me I should take it slow
The pace is not what matters, it's the direction that you go
Keep your feet upon the path and your eyes upon the goal
You'll have all the joy a heart could ever hold

And I call Him when I'm troubled and I call Him when I'm weak
And He always pulls me through my troubles some way and I believe

"Straight A’s In Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well a reading and a writing and arithmetic never did get through to me
It ain't because I'm square or thick, because I learned my ABC's
But when I graduated from the grammar school and I moved one grade above
I began to be a snook at books but I made straight A's in love

[Chorus]
Now the teacher would say to learn your algebrae but I'd bring home C's and D's
How could I make an A when there's a swinging maid
On the left and on the right and in the back and the front of me
Oh my grades are low on my card I know but they oughta give me one above
If they'd give me a mark for learning in the dark I'd have straight A's in love

[Verse 2]
Now in my senior year with graduation near I did my homework every night
And when my mama said I oughta go to bed I'd turn out all the lights
But my sweetie pie was waiting right outside she'd be a cooing like a dove
Though I did my best I failed semester test but I made straight A's in love
[Chorus]
Now the teacher would say to learn your algebrae but I'd bring home C's and D's
How could I make an A when there's a swinging maid
On the left and on the right and in the back and the front of me
Oh my grades are low on my card I know but they oughta give me one above
If they'd give me a mark for learning in the dark I'd have straight A's in loveEmbed"

When my hands are tired and my step is slow
Walk beside me and give me the strength to go
Fill my face with Your courage, so defeat won't show
Pick me up when I stumble, so the world won't know

[Chorus]
Lead me Father, with the staff of life
Give me the strength for a song
That the words I sing might more strength bring
To help some poor troubled, weary worker along

When my way is light but I still can see
With a strong hand, strike out the blindness in me
Show me work that I should carry on for Thee
Make my way straight and narrow like You wanted to be

"There’s A Bear In The Woods LyricsKevin Jones said, there's a bear in the woods
And if you don't believe it
Just ask Wesley Orbison and Lance Johnson
'cause they saw him, too
I was drivin' my jeep across the field
And when I came in to the edge of the woods
I saw Kevin Jones
Comin' down out of a tread
I stopped my jeep
And Kevin jumped up on the running board
And there it's when he said
There's a bear in the woods
And I looked right at Kevin
And I said, now Kevin, tell me the truth
And he looked at me right in the eye
He said, I'm not kiddin' you, Uncle John
He said, there's a bear in the woods
And if you don't believe it
Just ask Wesley Orbison and Lance Johnson
'cause they saw him, too
I kept on lookin' right at Kevin and I said
Now tell me truth, Kevin
He said, it is, it's a bear, it's a black bear
He said, it's not a big bear, but it's a bear
It's a black bear
I've seen him goin' down the trail there
I kept on lookin' at Kevin and I got to thinkin'
Now Kevin Jones said, there's a bear in the woods
Kevin was seven years old and I'm a lot older than he is
And I've done a lot of things that he hadn't done
And one of those things that I've done that he hadn't, is to lie
So I got to thinkin', if Kevin Jones says
There's a bear in the woods, who am I to doubt it
Well, I kind o' grinned at Kevin
And he jumped down off of the running board
And I started my jeep back up
And headed down the road in the woods
As I went away
I hollered back at Kevin and I said
Hey Kevin, watch out for that bear in the woods!Embed"
"Taller Than Trees Lyrics[Verse]
On your knees you are taller than trees
You can look over heartaches and pain
When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go, growing stronger and taller than trees
One night it was a long time ago now
I knelt at my mother's knee
And she said, Son lift up your eyes to Him in the skies
And you'll grow like the mighty oaks
But you son, created in the image of God
Can become taller even taller than the tallest of trees
And this was the answer I felt
As down at her knees I knelt
On your knees you're taller than trees
You can look over all your heartaches
And son you can look over all of your pains

When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go, growing stronger and taller than treesEmbed"
"Next in Line Lyrics[Verse]
The next in line will be someone who loves you
The next in line is me, because it's my time
Now how long will it be, till you end my misery
You better be prepared to linger, when you get to me
The time has come for you to love me, if you ever are
Come to me now, so I can make you mine
I watched them rush to you so fast
I waited so I'd be the last
It's my time, because I'm the next in line
The next in line will want your love forever
The next in line is me and here I am
Give me a day or two and I'll get through to you
You'd been my baby long ago, if you'd turned down a few
This old heart can't take much more waiting for your love
I'm tired and we're running short of time
I'll make you love me more than everyone before
It's my time to try, because I'm the next in line
I stood and watched you take their hearts
And break them one by one
My time is coming, so I waited while you had your fun
Now I'm through a-waiting way behind
It's my time, because I'm the next in line1Embed"
"The Fourth Man Lyrics[Verse]
They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knees to Idols made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the Fourth Man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn
Now the prophet Daniel tells about
Three men who walked with God
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Before the wicked king they stood
And the king commanded them bound and thrown
Into the fiery furnace that day
But the fire was so hot that the men were slain
That forced them on their way
Now when the three were cast in and the king rose up
To witness this awful fate
He began to tremble at what he saw
In astonished tones he spake
Did we not cast three men bound
Into the midst of the fire
Well, Lo, I see four men unhurt
Unbound and walking down there
[Outro]
There's Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
And the fiery coals they trod
But the form of the Fourth Man that I see
Is like the Son of GodEmbed"

Someone that can make me happy make me want to smile
Someone I'm going to have around me for a long long while
Someday we may meet again but I won't fall for you

I have heard of a land on the far away strand
This is a beautiful home of the soul
Built by Jesus on high, there we never shall die
This is a land where we never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old
In a land where we'll never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old
In a land where we'll never grow old
In that beautiful home where we'll never more roam
We shall be in the sweet by and by
Happy praise to the king thru eternity sing
This is a land where we never shall die
When our work here is done and the life crown is won
And out troubles and trials are o'er
All our sorrows will end and our voices will blend
With the loved ones who've gone on beforeEmbed"

And I drive the main road
Searching in the sun
For another overload

But it don't look like rain
And if it snows
That stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the lineEmbed"

Cause just about the time I think it's over I start missing you

It's just about time I had my sayin' I told you a thing or two
It's just about time I paid you back you treat me like you do

Rest your head on mommie's breast while daddy hums a tune
Are the old folks were humming the banjos were strumming
And the soft breezes sigh as in days long gone by
Way down in Missouri where I heard this melody
When I was a little fellow on my mommie's knee
The old folks were humming the banjos were strumming so sweet and low

Hush a bye my baby go to sleep on daddy's knee
Journey back to Dixie Land in dreams again with me
Oh, it seems like your daddy was there once again
And the old folks were strumming that same old refrain
Way down in Missouri when I heard this lullaby
While the stars were blinking and the moon was shining high
Are the old folks were humming the banjos were strumming so sweet and lowEmbed"

Who's wept
Through life's sorrows

Haired daddy of mine

If I could recall
All the heartaches
Dear old daddy

If I could erase
Those lines from your face

I own just to put a tone
To that silver

"Old Doc Brown Lyrics[Verse 1]
He was just an old country doctor in a little country town
Fame and fortune had passed him by, though we never saw him frown
As day by day in his kindly way, he'd serve us one and all
Many a patient forgot to pay although Doc's fees were small

[Verse 2]
Though he needed his dimes and there were times that he would receive a fee
He'd pass it onto some poor soul that needed it worse than he
He had to sell his furniture, couldn't pay his office rent
So to a dusty room over a livery stable, Doc Brown and his satchel went

[Verse 3]
And on the hitching post at the curb below to advertise his wares
He nailed a little sign that read ""Doc Brown has moved upstairs""
One day he didn't answer when they knocked upon his door
Old Doc Brown was lying down, but his soul was no more
[Verse 4]
They found him there in that old black suit, on his face was a smile of content
But all the money they could find on him was a quarter and a copper cent
So they opened up his ledger and what they saw gave their hearts a pull
Beside each debtor's name old Doc had writ these words ""Paid In Full""

[Verse 5]
Old Doc should've had a funeral fine enough for a king
It's a ghastly joke our town was broke and no one could give a thing
'Cept Jones the undertaker, he did mighty well
Donating an old iron casket he had never been able to sell

[Verse 6]
And the funeral procession it wasn't much for grace and pomp and style
But those wagon loads of mourners they stretched out for more than a mile
We wanted to give him a monument we kinda figured we owed him one
Because he made our town a better place for all the good he'd done

[Verse 7]
We pulled up that old hitchin' post where Doc had nailed his sign
We'd painted it white and to all of us, it certainly did look fine
Now the rains and the snows have washed away our white trimmin's of paint
There aren't nothing left but Doc's own sign and that's getting pretty faint

[Verse 8]
But you can still see that old hitching post, as if an answer to our prayers
Mutely tellin' the whole wide world Doc Brown has moved upstairsEmbed"
"Chain Gang Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was just a kid roaming around
Traveling through, a little old town
A man walked up and said come with me
You are broke and son that's vagrancy
A carefree lad that love to roam
But Lord I wish I'd stayed at home
The way it looks I'll probably hang
Because there is no hope on a chain gang

[Chorus]
I dig that ditch, I chop that corn
I curse the day that I was born
I believe it's better for a man to hang
Than to work like a dog on a chain gang
[Verse 2]
The guard stands there with a great big gun
I bet he'd love to see me run
And I guess, I probably will some day
I'd rather be dead than to live this way
He's well fed and he's six foot tall
And he's a meanest of them all
He cracks that whip and he swings that cane
That sun must've touched his brain

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I got a gal back home that's sweet and kind
But she's been waiting a long, long time
I just told her to forget my name
I won't ever live down the shame
Lord, deliver me from this hole
Before I lose my mind and soul
The flesh gets weak and the back gets broke
There is no because to laugh and joke

[Chorus]Embed"
"That Old Wheel Lyrics[Chorus]
That old wheel is going to roll around once more
When it does it will even up the score
Don’t be weak: as they sew, they will reap
Turn the other cheek and don’t give in
That old wheel will roll around again

[Verse 1]
When love is gone and the one you thought would stay
Does you wrong, and you are left alone to pay
The price is high
But somehow you’ll survive, don’t give in
That old wheel will roll around again

[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
There’ll be times, hard to control
And you’ll find you’ll hurt down in your soul
There’ll be those who’ll be glad to see you down
But don’t give in, that old wheel will roll around again

[Chorus] [x2]Embed"
"Me And Bobby Mcgee Lyrics[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, heading for the trains
Feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
Took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time and
Bobby clapping hands we finally sang up every song
That driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedoms just another word for nothing left to lose
And nothing isn’t worth nothing but its free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
[Verse 2]
From the coalmines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standing right beside me through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
The somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
She was looking for the love I hope shell find
Well I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding Bobbys body close to mine

[Chorus]Embed"
"Dear Mrs Lyrics[Verse]
Dear Mrs though we've never met I know very much about you
I know that you've got hair that shines like the morning sun
You've got eyes that hold the blueness of the sky
And of the deepest sea on a clear day and a smile that has a sparkle of a diamond
I know that because I've heard him say those things about you
These're the thoughts and the words of a man
Who spent many heart breaking years behind prison walls
The father of your children the man who worshipped the very ground that you walk on
He had a picture of you Mrs it was old and faded and torn
But you could tell at a glance that he never exaggerated in his thoughts and visions
He never left his cell without first checking to see if he had your picture with him
He was a young man when he first came to prison
And he talked a great deal about you but as the years passed he talked less and less
And during his last year here I don't believe he ever said a word to anybody
He had the appearance of a man much older than he really was
He walked with his head down and his shoulders sagging
And the walk itself seemed to take a great deal of effort
He never received a letter or had a visitor while he was here in prison
But never did he stop looking and waiting
Every day at mail call you could see him standing close to his bars
With the look of a child awaiting a reward
Even after the mailman had passed his cell his pleading eyes would follow begging
As always he'd feel of his shirt pocket and then just stand there
Staring at the emptiness and as always I could
Somehow feel the lump in his throat
And the burning in his eyes you know Mrs like just before you start to cry
Well I thought you might like to know that they buried his body today
Just outside the prison walls
They buried him there because nobody cared enough to claim his body
You know there was even a couple of old convicts there that actually cried
No not because they cared for him but for what he died from they cared for
Loneliness every prisoner knows loneliness but some know it more than others
The man that they buried today had died many times
Every day he waited hoping and praying for a letter or a card
Or just a note or anything to let him know that somewhere out there
Somebody cared for him
That assurance never came and today he died Mrs
He died from loneliness starved for love a love that nobody ever wanted
You see no man woman or child is immune to the need of love or to be loved
No matter how terrible his crime might have been
The death he died from today was more inhuman
But his suffering is over now and he's resting in a pauper's grave in a prison suit
And in his pocket is an old torn and faded picture of yes of you MrsEmbed"
"The Diplomat LyricsHe slowly raised the trembling hand
Gently brushed the silver strand of hair from his wrinkled brow
Lips that used to talk so free the eyes that used to beckon me were silent now
He listens to a passing train, gives into an old familiar pain, familiar pain
They retired him twenty years ago, gave him a watch made of gold and took his train
His woman's name was Margaret
He loved her but she went away and left his heart undone
He called this train the Diplomat, she's the only other lady that he ever loved
Some forty years he made the steam
From Memphis down to New Orleans but now he's off the line
And the closest that he ever gets Margaret or the Diplomat is in his mind
He said, take me to the station, the Diplomat is bringing Margaret home
Can't you hear that whistle blowing? They both know I've been alone for much too long
Let's not keep them waiting, we'll talk about the good times later on
Right now take me to the station, the Diplomat is bringing Margaret home
They say he talks crazy when
He sees the passing train or when he hears Margaret's name
But the only things he ever loved, he lost before he loved enough he's not to blame
So who's to say he's right or wrong
Reaching out and hanging on to dreams he can't let go
He threw the watch of gold away but keeps tracks of memories where he belongs
He said, take me to the station
They retired him twenty years ago, gave him a watch made of gold
And took daddy's trainEmbed"
"The Miracle Man LyricsI've had some hard times in years now gone by
I've had my heartaches my cup has been dry
But I've never been kicked and publicly scorned
And I've never worn a crown of thorns

But I have somebody who did that for me
The miracle man of Galilee

I've got scars that show that the goin' was rough
And I can remember when I almost gave up
But I've not been rejected by my fellow man
And I've never had nails through my hands

But I have somebody who suffered for me
The miracle man of Galilee
I've had disappointments they still come and go
They say man must suffer and it surely is so
I've had mountains to climb and I always will
But I don't have to climb Calvary's hill

But I have somebody who did that for me
The miracle man of GalileeEmbed"
"As Long As I Live Lyrics[Verse]
As long as I live if it be one hour or if it be one hundred years
I'll keep remembering forever and ever I'll love you dear as long as I live
It was easy said the night we parted that we'd forget we'd ever met
I haven't forgotten I wonder if you have or if your heart is full of regret
I never thought the night we parted that life without you could be so bad
I know it sounds funny but I can't forget you the only happiness I've ever hadEmbed"
"Let the Lower Lights Be Burning Lyrics[Verse 1]
Brightly beams our Father's mercy from his lighthouse evermore
But to us he gives the keeping of the lights along the shore

[Chorus]
Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save

[Verse 2]
Dark the night of sin has settled loud the angry billows roar
Eager eyes are watching longing for the lights along the shore

Trim your feeble lamp my brother, some poor sailor tempest tossed
Trying now to make the harbor in the darkness may be lost

"Sold Out Of Flagpoles Lyrics[Verse]
I walked down past the courthouse square three blocks or maybe four
Run into my old friend there who runs a handy hardware store
I said morning Lon what's the good word
He said Abraham Lincoln Lone Ranger Mickey Mouse and I'm sold out of flagpoles
I popped the top off a soda pop laid a quarter on the bar
I said inflation is a dirty dog my payday sure isn’t going far
Liberty said Lonnie E Pluribus Uni in God we trust and I'm sold out of flagpoles
I said hey Lonnie did you see Evel Knievel jumping on TV
Jumped 13 buses with his machine reckon he could jump 14
No doubt said Lonnie winners keep on winning
Even losers win sometimes and I'm sold out of flagpoles
Isn’t this been a year I said for frost and blight and flood and drought
Twice as many tornadoes reckon it's all caused by fallout
No it's the season said Lonnie they change
Wind's going to blow always did and I'm sold out of flagpoles
Hey what do you think about the sheriff's daughter
Running' off with the preacher's son
The sheriff's wife had to hold him back from going after them with his gun
Boys and girls said Lonnie will get together
Everything's normal and I'm sold out of flagpoles
And I'm sold out of flagpoles sold out of flagpoles sold out of flagpolesEmbed"
"Shepherd of My Heart Lyrics[Verse]
You're the shepherd of my heart so treat it tenderly
It's a heart that needs your everloving care
You're the shepherd of my heart until eternity lead it not into the valley of despair
While it's in your keeping guard it with your love
Shelter it from harm along life's way
You're the shepherd of my heart and darling honestly
It's a heart that will not ever go astray
You're the shepherd of my heart so surely you must know
You have but to speak and my heart will obey
It's at your command my dear because it loves you so
So my darling shepherd guide it where you may
If it be green pastures or a rocky road it will follow you and not ask why

[Outro]
You're the shepherd of my heart until the trumpet blows
And I go to meet the shepherd in the skyEmbed"

"The Running Kind LyricsI was born the running kind, leaving always on my mind
Home was never home to me at anytime
Every front door found me open I would find the back door open
There just had to be an exit for the running kind

Within me there's a prison, surrounding me alone
As real as any dungeon with its walls of stone
I know running's not the answer, but running's been my nature
And the thing in me that keeps me moving on

I was born the running kind, leaving always on my mind
Home was never home to me at anytime
Every front door found me open I would find the back door open
There just had to be an exit for the running kindEmbed"
"Ballad of the Harp Weaver Lyrics[Verse]
Son said my mother when I was knee high
You need of clothes to cover you and not a rag have I
There's nothing in the house to make a boy's britches
Nor shears to cut a cloth with nor thread to take stitches
There's nothing in the house but a leaf end of rye
And the harp with a with the woman's head nobody will by and she began to cry
That was in the early fall and when came the late fall
Son she said the sight of you makes your mother's blood crawl
Little skinny shoulder blades sticking through your clothes
And where you get a jacket from God above knows
It's lucky for me lad your daddy's in the ground
And can't see the way I let his son go around and she made a queer sound
That was in the late fall when the winter came
I'd not a pair of bridges nor a shirt to my name
I couldn't go to school or out of doors to play
And all the other little boys passed our way
Son said my mother come climb into my lap
And I'll chave your little knees while you take a nap
And oh but we were silly for half an hour or more
Me with my long legs dragging on the floor
I rocked rocked rocked to a mother goose rhyme
Oh but we were happy for half an hour's time
But there was I a great boy and what would folks say
To hear my mother singing me to sleep all day in such a daft way
Men say the winter was bad that year fuel was scarce and food was dear
A wind with a wolf's head howled about our door
And we burned up the chairs and sat upon the floor
All that was left us was a chair we couldn't break
And the harp with the woman's head nobody would take for song or pity sake
The night before Christmas I cried with the cold
I cried myself to sleep like a two year old
And in the deep night I felt my mother rise
And stare down upon me with love in her eyes
I saw my mother sitting on the one good chair
A light falling on her face from I couldn't tell where
Looking nineteen and not a day older
And the harp with the woman's head leaned against her shoulder
Her thin fingers moving in the thin tall strings
Were weave weave weaving wonderful things
Many bright threads from where I couldn't see
Were running through the harp strings rapidly
And gold threads whistling through my mother's hands
I saw the web grow and the pattern expand
She wove a child's jacket and when it was done
She laid it on the floor and wove another one
She wove a red cloak so regal to see
She's made it for a king's son I said and not for me but I knew it was for me
She wove a pair of bridges and quicker than that
She wove a pair of boots a little cocked hat
She wove a pair of mittens she wove a little blouse
She wove all night in the still cold house
She sang as she worked and the harp strings spoke
But her voice never faltered and the thread never broke
But when I awoke there sat my mother
With the harp against her shoulder looking nineteen and not a day older
A smile about her lips and a light about her head
And her hands in the harp strings frozen dead
And piled up beside her toppling to the skies
Were the clothes of a king's son just my size1Embed"
"One Too Many Mornings Lyrics[Verse 1]
Down the street the dogs are barking
And the day is getting dark
As the night comes in falling
The dogs will lose their bark
And the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind

[Chorus]
For I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

[Verse 2]
From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes they start to fade
As I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
And I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's a restless hungry feeling
That don't mean no one no good
When everything I'm saying
You can say it just as good
You're right from your side
I'm right from mine

"I’ve Got A Thing About Trains Lyrics[Verse]
Train train train I've got a thing about trains
I get a sad kind of feeling when I see a passenger train
In this fast moving world that we live in nobody rides them much these days
Maybe I'm a little sentimental cause I know that things have to change
But I'd still like to go for a train ride cause I've got a thing about trains
Train train train you're fading from the scene
But you've had your days of glory train train train
Train they say you're too slow for traveling but I'm going to miss you some day
When my little boy says daddy what was it like to ride a train
I'll just say it was a good way to travel when things didn't move quite so fast
And I'm sorry son that you can't ride one the trains are the thing of the past

[Outro]
Train train train you're fading from the scene
And I'm going to mourn your passing train train train
I've got a thing about trainsEmbed"
"Blistered Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've got great big blisters on my bloodshot
Eyes from looking at that long legged woman up ahead
What she does simply walking down the sidewalk of the city
Makes me think about a stray cat getting fed
He's got a whole lot of motion in her soul, I know
But her soul ain't the place she lets it show

[Chorus]
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
Lord I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah
She done tore my soul apart, put big blisters on my heart
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go

[Verse 2]
I've got great big blisters on my fingertips
From reaching in my pocket book and picking out the bills
And I got tiny white blisters in my throat
From trying to ease my nervous tension taking all them pat and pills
And ever since she started running around from bar to bar
I just can't eat a bite or keep my stomach settled down

She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
Oh I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

"Come In Stranger Lyrics[Chorus]
She said come in stranger

[Verse 1]
It's good to have you home
I hurried through because I knew it was you
When I saw your dog, wagging his tail
Honey, why didn't you let me know by mail
You've been gone so long

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I know you're weary from all your miles
Just sit right there in your easy chair
And tell me all about the places you've been
How long it'll be before you leave again
I hope it's a long, long while
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Everything around home is fine
I've watched and I've waited for you to get back
And I missed you all the time

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Oh how I need you when you're gone
I walk the floor and I watch the door
And when I lie awake and wonder where you can be
I'd give anything to have you here with me
I get so lonesome all alone

And won't you listen to my plea
Stay long enough, so that the one I love
Is not a stranger to me1Embed"
"Sing A Traveling Song Lyrics[Verse]
Hey little girl with tears in your eyes
Don't waste your time now asking me why
I don't know I know I'll just be moving along
You say that home is where my love is at
I said that home is where I hang my head
The time has come to sing a traveling song
You want a house and a lot of close friends
I love the feel of my back to the wind
The two won't match you know the cage they wile would be wrong
You think that love is friends a child and a home
You can't buy love on a twenty year alone
The time has come to sing a traveling song
Someday where we sat in your old porch swing
A tamer man may offer you a ring
A man that wants his friends and neighbors a child and a home
Don't waste your tears on love that never could be
What's right for others just ain't right for me
The time has come to sing a traveling song mhmm mhmEmbed"

Born to lose, I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue

Born to lose, it seems so hard to bear
How I long to always have you near
You've grown tired, and now you say we're through

Born to lose, my every hope is gone
It's so hard to face that empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew

There is no use to dream of happiness
All I see is only loneliness
All my life, I've always been so blue

"I Can’t Help It (If I’m Still In Love With You) LyricsToday I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly, I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

It's hard to know, another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh, Heaven only knows how much I miss you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with youEmbed"

I saw his eyes drink in your charms
While he held you in his arms

I stood and watched him steal a kiss
From two lips I know I'll miss
And I couldn't keep from crying

"Drink To Me Only With Thine Eyes LyricsDrink to me only with thine eyes
And I will pledge with mine
Or leave a kiss within the cup
And I'll not ask for wine
The thirst that from the soul doth rise
Doth ask a drink divine;
But might I of Jove's nectar sip
I would not change for thine

I sent thee late a rosy wreath
Not so much hon'ring thee
As giving it a hope that there
It could not withered be;
But thou thereon did'st only breathe
And sent'st it back to me
Since when it grows and smells, I swear
Not of itself, but thee
Drink to me only with thine eyes
And I will pledge with mine
Or leave a kiss within the cup

The thirst that from the soul doth rise
Doth ask a drink divine;

"I’d Still Be There Lyrics[Verse 1]
I overlooked a lot of things I knew I should have done
I did things that I'm sorry for I lived to have my fun
But now the world that once was bright is empty and bare
And if you wouldn't be ashamed of me I'd still be there
I'd be with you where I belong
And nothing they could do or say could make me think it's wrong
If all the love that made you mine could make you still care

I'd be by your side I'd still be there

[Verse 2]
I'd give the world if I could only have you close to me
I'd pray the Lord to keep you safe wherever you may be

If I only knew you loved me too I'd still be there
I'd be with you where I belong

"Always Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Always alone alone and blue
I've got no one to tell my troubles to
No one to care to call my own

I need you so but we're so far apart
You didn't care I should have known
That you would go and leave me all alone

[Verse 3]
There is no one to take your place
Each night in dreams I see your smiling face
Then I awake and find you gone
I know that I must always be aloneEmbed"
"The Gettysburg Address Lyrics[Intro]
Four score and seven years ago so began the message
Of a war-weary President Abraham Lincoln
A message written on the back of an envelope on a train
On the way to dedicate a battlefield
Where men from the north and south had died at Gettysburg Pennsylvania

[Verse]
Four score and seven years ago our forefathers brought forth on this continent
A new nation conceived in liberty
And dedicated in the proposition that all men are created equal
Now we're engaged in a great Civil War
Testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived
And so dedicated can long endure
We are met on a great battlefield of that war
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field
As the final resting place for those who here gave their lives
That that nation might live
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this
But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate
We cannot hallow this ground
For the brave men living and dead who struggled here
Have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
The world will little notice or long remember what we say here
But it can never forget what they did here
It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work
Which they who fought here have thus so nobly advanced
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us
That from these honored dead we take increased devotion
To that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion
That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died
In vain and that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom
And the government of the people by the people and for the people
Shall not perish from the earthEmbed"

Down the wilderness road
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap

There was a time when going way out west meant going to Kaintuck
The dark and bloody ground as Indians called it
Indians wars were ragin' and men like Daniel Boone and Michael Stoner
Came down the wilderness road like countless families did
Through a place in south West Virginia called Big Moccasin Gap
It's a hot day in '73 and this is my wife and my kids with me
Daniel Boone lost his boy the other day young Jim Boone is dead twenty miles away
The wagons turn and went back home even Daniel couldn't make it alone
I guess probably Daniel could but he stopped awhile in castle wood
[Bridge]
If you love your wife and love your baby man
Turn your wagons back as soon as you can
Every Injun in these hills has gone berserk you never gonna make it to Kaintuck
Ah I bet I'm going to make it to Kaintuck

[Chorus]
We're going west to Kaintuck down the road to Moccasin Gap
Down the wilderness road
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap

[Outro]
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin GapEmbed"
"Just as I Am Lyrics[Verse]
Just as I am without one plea but that Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bid’s me come to Thee oh lamb of God I come I come
Just as I am and waiting not to rid my soul of one dark blot
To Thee who's blood can cleanse each spot oh lamb of God I come I come
Just as I am Lord Thou tossed about with many a conflict and many a doubt
Fighting’s fears within and without oh lamb of God I come I come
Just as I am Thou wilt receive will dwell come pardon cleanse relieve
Because Thy promise I believe oh lamb of God I come I comeEmbed"
"The Bug That Tried to Crawl Around the World Lyrics[Verse]
Now you've heard of folks with a lot of ambition
But I believe just about the biggest case of ambition I ever saw
Was in a bug that I saw crawling along the beach one day
He was a mighty ambitious bug
On the beach one early morning as a day was newly dawning
And the sun again was warmin all the chill through out the land
I saw me a bug a walking and at first I thought he was quaking
Then I found out he was talking while he crawled across the sand
He was crawling mighty straight at a slow but a steady gait
And when I asked him to wait he said oh come on crawl with me
But I said where you going and he said you'll be knowing
For I'm going to make a showing and you'll someday see
Well I stood there by the ocean I suddenly had the notion
That I start this big promotion so this challenge I enfirled said the bug
So I gave my wife a hug and I left my confy rug
So I could be the only bug that ever crawled around the world
Well he seemed mighty small and it was a long way to crawl
And I'm sure he couldn't swim at all so I try to discourage my friend
I said you know the world is round and there's mighty lot of ground
And there some water to be found before you reach your journey's end
And he said now don't you fret there's problems to be met
But I'll make it you can bet and this deed will bring glory to my name
You know they said man would never fly now he's soarin' in the sky
Because he had the will to try so let me win my fame
So he crawled on out of sight as he sought that splendoured height
Neither looking left nor right but slowly marching toward his goal
And my knowing he had started on his journey as we parted
Kept me from feeling too down hearted for he was a mighty ambitious soul
Well I've looked everywhere I've been and seen a lot of bugs since then
But not one quite like my little friend when I think of him I'm filled with pride
Did he make it I don't know he was crawling mighty slow and he had a long way to go
And all I can tell you folks is that he tried he sure was an ambitious bugEmbed"
"Katy Too Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not the going steady kind
I miss them all, all the time
I told Annie I'd be true
But I still think about Katy too

[Chorus]
Katy too, Katy too
I still think about Katy too

[Verse 2]
If you should see miss Mary-Ann
Just tell her I'm her loving man
Give my love to Jane and Sue
But don't forget ol' Katy too
[Chorus]
Katy too, Katy too
Don't forget ol' Katy too

I like Sadie's chicken stew
And Suzie's good at stitching wool
I like Mary's barbecue
But I still like ol' Katy too

Now, girls I'm not the flirty kind
But I just can't make up my mind
I'd like to marry all of you
But I still miss ol' Katy too

To all the girls I make this toast

I got more girls than I can see
But if you give me all but two
Then let's squeeze in ol' Katy too

Let's squeeze in ol' Katy tooEmbed"
"I’ll Be Loving You Lyrics[Verse 1]

When your friends don’t call you like you thought they would
When you can’t get over me like you thought you could
When you can’t forget me the way you planned to do, remember

"Hard Times Come Again No More LyricsLet us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There’s a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times, come again no more

'Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more

While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times, come again no more

'Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more
There’s a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
With a worn heart, whose better days are o'er
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day
Oh, hard times, come again no more

'Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more

'Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no moreEmbed"
"In the Garden Lyrics[Verse 1]
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses

[Chorus]
And he walks with me
And he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known

[Verse 2]
He speaks, and the sound of his voice
Is so sweet, the birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me
Within my heart is ringing
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'll stay in the garden with him
Though the night around me be falling
And he bids me go, through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling

[Chorus]Embed"
"Saginaw, Michigan LyricsI was born in Saginaw Michigan and I grew up in a house on Saginaw bay
My daddy was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay
I loved a girl in Saginaw Michigan she was the daughter of a very, very wealthy man
But he called me that son of a Saginaw fisherman
And not good enough to ever claim his daughter's hand

That's why I'm up here in Alaska lookin' around for gold
Like a crazy fool I'm diggin' in the frozen ground so cold
But with each day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw Michigan

I wrote my love in Saginaw Michigan
I said honey I'm a coming home please wait for me
And you can tell your dad that I'm coming back a richer man
I hit the biggest strike in Klondyke history
Her daddy met the bus in Saginaw Michigan
And he gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said son you're a wise young, ambitious man
Why don't you sell your father-in-law your Klondyke claim

Now he's up there in Alaska diggin' in the cold, cold ground
That greedy fool is a lookin' for the gold I never found
But it serves him right and nobody here is missing him
Least of all the newly weds of Saginaw MichiganEmbed"
"When The Savior Reached Down For Me Lyrics(When he reached down his hand for me)
Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way I was wretched and vile as could be
But my Saviour in love gave me peace from above
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down his hand for me when he reached way down for me
I was lost and undone without my God or his son
When he reached down his hand for me

I was near to despair when he came to me there
And he showed me that I could be free
Then he lifted my feet gave me gladness complete
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down...Embed"
"Have You Ever Seen The Rain? Lyrics[Verse 1]
Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know, and it's been coming for some time
When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know, shining down like water

[Chorus]
I Want to know, have you ever seen the rain?[x2]
Coming down sunny day?

[Verse 2]
Yesterday, and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time
Until forever on it goes
Through the circle fast and slow
I know, and it can't stop, I wonder
[Chorus][x2]Embed"
"After Taxes Lyrics[Verse 1]
I feel so good come payday
I think of all the things I'm going to
Buy when I pick up my pay
Don't you know, but then they hand me
That little brown envelope
I peep inside, Lord I lose all hope
Because from those total wages earned
Down to that net amount that's due
I feel the painful sense of loss between the two

[Chorus]
There goes that bracelet for her arm
There goes that new fence for my farm
There goes that brand new Pontiac
There goes the shirt right off my back
[Verse 2]
You can dream about a honeymoon for two
You can dream but that's about all you can do
Because by the time old Uncle Sam gets through with you
You can buy her a pair of hose
A little powder for her nose
And take her down to Sloppy Joe's for beer
And stew them are the facts after tax
You can dream about vacation in the sun
You can dream but you can never have you one
Because by the time your good old Uncle Sam gets done
You've got just enough for gas
To see them city limits pass
And if you get back home fourth class
I'd say you won

[Chorus]Embed"
"I Could Never Be Ashamed Of You Lyrics[Verse]
Everybody says you let me down
I should be ashamed to take you round
Makes no difference what you used to do
Darling I could never be ashamed of you

Maybe you were reckless yesterday
But together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true
Darling I could never be ashamed of you

All the happiness I've ever known
Came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through
Darling I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you've been cheated in the past
And perhaps those memories will always last
Even though you prove to be untrue
Darling I could never be ashamed of youEmbed"
"This Town Lyrics[Intro]
This Town

[Verse]
This town is not for me
I won't be staying around
This town is hard and cold
I'm not happy in this town
I'll pick up my heart and I'll go
Where to I don't care or know
Don't matter where I'll be found
As long as I leave this town
This town wants me to go
It ain't where I was bound
This town don't need me here
I don't need this town

To morrow who'll remember my name
To morrow who'll remember I came
Don't care which road I'll go down
As long as it's a way from this townEmbed"
"That Lucky Old Sun LyricsUp in the mornin', out on a job
Work like the devil for my pay
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
A fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Good Lord up above, can't you hear me cryin'
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with your silvery linin'
Lift lead to paradise
Oh, show me that river, take me across
Wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun gave me nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Like that lucky old sun gave me nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all dayEmbed"
"Galway Bay LyricsIf you ever go across the sea to Ireland
It maybe at the closing of your day
You will sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay
Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream
The women in the meadow making hay
And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin
And watch the barefoot gosoons at their play

For the breezes blowin' o'er the sea from Ireland
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow
And the women in the uplands diggin' praties
Speak a language that the strangers do not know

Yet the stangers came and tried to teach us their way
They scorned us just for bein' what we are
But they might as well go chasing after moon beams
Or light a penny candle from a star
And if there's is going to be a life hereafter
And somehow I am sure there's going to be
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven
In that dear land across the Irish seaEmbed"
"Roughneck Lyrics[Chorus]
Born to be a roughneck
I'll never amount to nothing
Pulling case and laying pipe
Is hard labor

[Verse 1]
Well, I was born in a boomer shack
About a half mile from town
Papa was a driller on a wildcat crew
And my mama never was around
I learn to cuss when I was two
And fight when I was three
And by the time I was five there was no kid alive
Could ever get the best of me
[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well, I started working like a regular man
When I was just about knee high
Skinning the knuckles with my two bare hands
But they never heard me cry
I remember walking down the road
And hearing somebody say
He was born to live a rougneck's life
And he's never going to change his ways

[Chorus] [x2]1Embed"
"He’ll Understand And Say Well Done Lyrics[Verse 1]
Give, when you give Him the best of your service
Tellin' the world that the savior has come
Be not dismayed if man don't believe you
He'll understand and say, Well done

[Chorus]
Oh, when I come to the end of my journey
Weary of life and the battle is won
Bearing the staff and the cross of redemption
He'll understand and say, Well done

He'll understand and say, Well done

[Verse 2]
Misunderstood the savior of sinners
Died on the cross, He was God's only Son
But He knew well that his Father in Heaven
Would understand and say, Well done
[Chorus]Embed"
"When I Take My Vacation in Heaven Lyrics[Verse]
There are those who are taking vacations
To the mountains the lakes and the sea
Where they rest from their cares and their troubles
What a wonderful time that must be
But it seems not my lot to be like them
I must toil through the heat and the cold
Seeking out the lost sheep on a mountain
Bringing wanderers back to the fold
But when I take my vacation in Heaven
What a wonderful time that will be
Hearing concerts by the Heavenly chorus
And the face of my Saviour I'll see

[Chorus][x2]
Sitting down on the banks of the river
Beneath the shade of the evergreen tree
There I'll rest from my burdens forever
Won't you take your vacation with meEmbed"
